# VI. Critique of Literature

## Overarching Critique Criterion

1. Rigor in Action-Research Methods
    - Research question(s) and/or hypothesis(es)
        - Appropriateness of the methods to the research question(s) and/or hypothesis(es)
    - Appropriateness of the methods to the population
        - Sampling frame definition
    - Data collection modality/modalities
    - Analytic approach \& procedures
    - Presentation \& Interpretation(s) of results
    - Limitations description, interpretation, and justification
    - Application \& dissemination of research and findings
2. How the methods facilitate the inclusion or exclusion of specific populations
    - Whether and how (where applicable) exclusion of specific populations is justified.
3. How the methods facilitate the inclusion or exclusion of _sexual minority women_
    - Whether and how (where applicable) exclusion of _sexual minority women_ is justified.

`r tufte::newthought("1. Stakeholder Input.")` Are efforts made to ensure that _all available_ stakeholders' and informants' voices and accessibility considered equally, and that certain voices are not unjustifiably privileged over others?

`r tufte::newthought("3. Interpretations of Findings.")` Is feedback from key stakeholders and informants to the research accepted and genuinely considered by the core research team? Are efforts made to ensure that _all available_ stakeholders' and informants' voices and accessibility considered equally, and that certain voices are not unjustifiably privileged over others?

`r tufte::newthought("4. Research Dissemination.")` Are key stakeholders and informants to the research given access to reports of a given project's progress and/or findings? Is such access in fact accessible (i.e., free and easy to locate)?


Research conducted within the subset of community psychology focused around intimate partner violence will be initially evaluated according to the level of inclusion and exclusion of the historically marginalized population of interest (i.e., sexual minority women). The implementation of community psychology methodologies and analytic approaches will then be reviewed within each of these categories (i.e., inclusion or exclusion of sexual minority women) in terms of (1) the appropriateness of the methods to the research question, (2) how the methods facilitated the inclusion or exclusion of sexual minority women, and (3) whether and how (where applicable) exclusion of sexual minority women is justified.
