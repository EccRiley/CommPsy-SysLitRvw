`r tufte::newthought("1. Stakeholder Input.")` Are efforts made to ensure that _all available_ stakeholders' and informants' voices and accessibility considered equally, and that certain voices are not unjustifiably privileged over others?

`r tufte::newthought("3. Interpretations of Findings.")` Is feedback from key stakeholders and informants to the research accepted and genuinely considered by the core research team? Are efforts made to ensure that _all available_ stakeholders' and informants' voices and accessibility considered equally, and that certain voices are not unjustifiably privileged over others?

`r tufte::newthought("4. Research Dissemination.")` Are key stakeholders and informants to the research given access to reports of a given project's progress and/or findings? Is such access in fact accessible (i.e., free and easy to locate)?
