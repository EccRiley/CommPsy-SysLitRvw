In addition, although the research presented in the present review can be separated into various groupings, there is a common factor among the formally reviewed literature, which is that each of the reviewed studies addressed research questions and hypotheses through multiple levels of analysis. However, important differences and patterns exist regarding which levels of analysis are involved in each of the reviewed studies. +@ig:keysnet provides both a visual description of the levels of analysis involved in each of the reviewed studies, as well as an analytic depiction of the relations among the reviewed studies based on the level(s) of analysis involved in each study. Several important pieces of information can be seen in this graphical representation, the first, and possibly most obvious, of which is that the vast majority of the reviewed literature can be characterized as crossing the individual and community levels of analysis, whereas a minority of the reviewed studies can be characterized as intersecting from either the individual, community, or relationship level of analysis with the societal level of analysis.
