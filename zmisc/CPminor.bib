  abstract={Participatory action research (PAR) is defined and the scope and limits of the term are explored according to a continuum of control, collaboration, and commitment in the research process. Some researchers are committed to what appears to be a purist ideological paradigm of PAR that wholly locates control in the hands of participants and produces higher order social action and change. Others appear to endorse a more inclusive vision of PAR that can be defined by any number of approaches to involving community members in research. Acknowledging these differences, this chapter attempts to represent a diverse range of projects and theoretical approaches to participatory work. Other aspects of PAR are explained, including researcher reflexivity and redefining the researcher's role as a catalyst for social change, empowerment, learning how to learn, social change and transforming social realities, and approaching data collection and interpretation using multiple epistemologies. The authors discuss the relevance of PAR to community psychology, cover general principles for implementing PAR in community research, and share their experiences using this research approach with people with chronic illness and disabilities.}

  abstract={Participatory action research represents a stance within qualitative research methods--an epistemology that assumes knowledge is rooted in social relations and most powerful when produced collaboratively through action. With a long and global history, participatory action research (PAR) has typically been practiced within community-based social action projects with a commitment to understanding, documenting, or evaluating the impact that social programs, social problems, or social movements bear on individuals and communities. PAR draws on multiple methods, some quantitative and some qualitative, but at its core it articulates a recognition that knowledge is produced in collaboration and in action. With this chapter, the authors aim to accomplish four ends: to provide a cursory history of PAR; to introduce a PAR project the authors have undertaken in a women's prison in New York, documenting the impact of college on women in prison, the prison environment, and on the women's postrelease outcomes; to present findings and analysis; and, to articulate a set of reflection on their work as a PAR collective, the dilemmas of writing openly under surveillance.}

Findings from these studies may assist other researchers or practitioners in seeing fruitful avenues for social interventions. The results of applied social psychology studies may be used by social activists to inform their demands or by government officials to help devise their policy recommendations. But in most of these cases, the goal of the research has not been to deliberately create social change. The research that you will read about in this chapter has explicit social or situational change goals. That is, the research, to a greater or lesser extent, was developed to change something about the specific situation right at that time rather than, or as well as, later" [pp. 355-356].}

  abstract={Epidemiologists and social scientists agree that place shapes health. But the model of “risk factor” epidemiology faces limits in explaining how neighborhoods, as complex systems, produce health or disease. This paper describes how visual methods can advance epidemiological inquiry. Drawing from the work of The Health of Philadelphia Photo-documentation Project (HOPPP), this paper asks the following question: how can visual methods inform the work of epidemiologists? The project was conducted in three contiguous neighborhoods that represent a steep socioeconomic gradient. Photographs served as a stimulus for probing the sources of health variation across neighborhoods. The project incorporated three visual data sources: 1) “outsider perspective” images gathered systematically by staff photographers on randomly sampled blocks; 2) “insider perspective” images taken by adult residents during their daily routines; and 3) collaborative images taken by staff photographers in partnership with local participants. During in-depth interviews, these photographs served as prompts to elicit residents' health concerns and beliefs regarding urban environmental causes of good and poor health (“street-level etiologies”). We found that visual methods generated etiologic insights regarding the production of urban health and illness. Photographs enabled systematic observation of urban neighborhoods by the research team; engaged urban residents as active agents in the search for the underlying causes of urban health disparities; and created a social bridge between researchers and urban residents.}

  abstract={"In this chapter, we return to the topic of program theory, not as a framework for identifying evaluation questions, but as a constituent part of the program that is being evaluated. The social problems that programs address are often so complex and difficult that bringing about even small improvements may pose formidable challenges. A program’s theory is the conception of what must be done to bring about the intended social benefits. As such, it is the foundation on which every program rests. A program’s theory can be a good one, in which case it represents the “know-how” necessary for the program to attain the desired results, or it can be a poor one that would not produce the intended effects even if implemented well. One aspect of evaluating a program, therefore, is to assess how good the program theory is— in particular, how well it is formulated and whether it presents a plausible and feasible plan for improving the target social conditions. For program theory to be assessed, however, it must first be expressed clearly and completely enough to stand for review. Accordingly, this chapter describes how evaluators can describe the program theory and then assess how good it is" [p. 133].}

  abstract={"To be effective in bringing about the desired improvements in social conditions, a program needs more than a good plan of attack. Most important, the program must implement its plan; that is, it must actually carry out its intended functions in the intended way. Although implementing a program concept may seem straightforward, in practice it is often very difficult. Social programs typically must contend with many adverse influences that can compromise even well-intentioned attempts to conduct program business appropriately. The result can easily be substantial discrepancies between the program as intended and the program as actually implemented. The implementation of a program is reflected in concrete form in the program processes that it puts in place. An important evaluation function, therefore, is to assess the adequacy of program process: the program activities that actually take place and the services that are actually delivered in routine program operation. This chapter introduces the procedures evaluators use to investigate these issues" [p. 169].}

  abstract={"The previous chapter discussed how a program’s process and performance can be monitored. The ultimate goal of all programs, however, is not merely to function well, but to bring about change— to affect some problem or social condition in beneficial ways. The changed conditions are the intended outcomes or products of the programs. Assessing the degree to which a program produces these outcomes is a core function of evaluators. A program’s intended outcomes are ordinarily identified in the program’s impact theory. Sensitive and valid measurement of those outcomes is technically challenging but essential to assessing a program’s success. In addition, ongoing monitoring of outcomes can be critical to effective program management. Interpreting the results of outcome measurement and monitoring, however, presents a challenge to stakeholders because a given set of outcomes can be produced by factors other than program processes. This chapter describes how program outcomes can be identified, how they can be measured and monitored, and how the results can be properly interpreted" [p. 203].}

First, a decision about the priority of the two methods selects either a qualitative or a quantitative approach to be the principal method. Second, a decision about sequencing determines whether the complementary method will serve as either a preliminary or a follow-up to the principal method. These two decisions yield four basic research designs: (a) preliminary qualitative methods in a quantitative study, (b) preliminary quantitative methods in a qualitative study, (c) follow-up qualitative methods in a quantitative study, and (d) follow-up quantitative methods in a qualitative study. The conclusions consider further research designs and the expertise necessary for multiple-methods research.}

  year={2002},
  abstract={Community psychologists and other social scientists have underscored the limitations of traditional scientific paradigms for research with diverse cultural groups. For instance, Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) discussion of the “social address” model and Howard and Scott’s (1981) discussion of “deficiency formulations“each criticize the comparative frameworks, which dominate the literature on ethnic minorities in the United States. They argue that comparative frameworks simply describe between-group differences on particular outcome variables of interest, providing little insight into the range of social and psychological processes that occur within a cultural group. Other scholars have questioned the validity of studies utilizing constructs and measures developed in one cultural group to understand phenomenon in another (Boykin, 1979). Cultural norms, values, and experiences influence the relevance of a set of constructs to respondents, the range of behaviors and ideas that are valid indicators of the constructs, and how respondents interpret items employed to assess them (Hui & Triandis, 1989; Marsella & Kameoka, 1989). Inattention to these sorts of issues can undermine the accuracy of scientific knowledge about both intragroup processes and between-group similarities and differences.}

We critically examine the assumption that qualitative research serves to reveal or amplify the voices of participants. We examine connections between qualitative research and social change and describe the use of qualitative research to not only empower marginalized groups, but also to critique and transform privileged groups.

However, a survey of empirical articles published in the American Journal of Community Psychology shows that community scientists utilize a narrow range of statistical tools that are not well suited to assess contextual data. Multilevel modeling, geographic information systems (GIS), social network analysis, and cluster analysis are recommended as useful tools to address contextual questions in community science. An argument for increased methodological consilience is presented, where community scientists are encouraged to adopt statistical methodology that is capable of modeling a greater proportion of the data than is typical with traditional methods.}
