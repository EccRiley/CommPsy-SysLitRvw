<!-- Research and activism in the United States over the past several decades has worked to dispel the myth that intimate partner violence occurs only in the home as a private matter, but rather, is both exemplary and symptomatic of more insidious societal issues [@black2011national; @tjaden2000full; @walters2013nationa]. This work has largely been attributed to the U.S. Women’s and Domestic Violence movements characteristic of second-wave feminism. However, a major downfall of these movements is that the theoretical and rhetorical frameworks utilized by second-wave feminism, particularly with regard to the U.S. Domestic Violence movement, are based in large part on the notion of a gender binary that allows for the perpetuation of assumptions around “who” can be a perpetrator and who can be a victim [@messinger2011invisible]. The logic behind this rhetorical framework is based on data gathered throughout these movements showing that women are disproportionately more likely to be victimized, and that men are disproportionately more like to perpetrate IPV [@tjaden2000full]. These gendered assumptions also attribute particular characteristics of traditional masculinity (e.g., dominance, toughness, aggression, anger, etc.) and femininity (e.g., subordination, weakness, and unintelligent) to popular conceptions of perpetrators (assumed to be male and masculine) and victims [assumed to be female and feminine; @johnson2006conflict; @vannatta2005constructing]. However, a critically overlooked challenge to these assumptions is the existence of IPV among members of the LGBTQ community, and the continued silence, and sometimes deliberate ignorance, around this phenomenon [@elliot1996shattering; @messinger2011invisible]. `The overall silencing of LGBTQ-IPV has concerning likely origins that intersect with the dangerous consequences of this silence and of this phenomenon as a whole. In particular, LGBTQ individuals have historically faced explicit and often violent oppressions that have been structurally and institutionally sanctioned, including structural and institutional attempts to silence the voices within this community` [@durish2011documenting]. -->

> "In 1977, eight men who were friends of women's activists in the Boston area came together to form a men's collective called _EMERGE_ [@adams1982men]. They began to provide services to batterers. Their creation of services for batterers responded to the frustration of shelter workers who noted that women were being beaten when they returned home, and to the observation that some men were moving from one violent relationship to another. _EMERGE_ became one of the first organizations to offer group treatment for men who batter. The growth of services for batterers rapidly followed the founding of _EMERGE_ [@feazell1984services; @pirog1985male]" [@tolman1995intervention, p. 2; @adams2002emerge].

> "During the same period that batterers programs were being established, the dramatic proliferation of family treatment models resulted in attempts at counseling couples and families with men who abused their partners [@coleman1980conjugal; @cook1984systemic; @geller1982conjoint; @geller1977treatment; @margolin1979conjoint]. The use of these models for intervention with batterers has created a great deal of controversy, however, family and couple treatment interventions constitute a small minority of interventions discussed or evaluated in the research literature" [@tolman1995intervention, pp. 2-3].

"The patriarchal model of domestic violence is not an individual-level model, but a socio-cultural model that sees change coming from altering the patriarchal social structure, not individual men. Thus, advocates were less surprised than researchers about evaluation research being unable to reject the null hypothesis; they were pessimistic from the start about the ability of therapy, counseling, or treatment to change men" [@gelles2001standards; p. 17].
