\part{Epilogue: Reflections on the Process of Writing this Review}

At multiple junctures leading up to and during the development of this review, questions and suggestions along the lines of "Why not broaden the scope to include sexual minority _men_", or "perhaps remove the focal population restriction from the review's scope altogether" were posed by a handful of the author's close advisors and peers. The present review was fact deliberately poised to potentially, or rather likely, fail in finding an adequate body of literature covering the present review's primary substantive research topic and underlying purpose. That is, having spent several years researching, witnessing, and at times living in the contexts IPV among sexual minority women, most often within or intersecting with community-psychology-specific research frameworks, the author was quite aware of the overall dearth of empirical research conducted on this specific topic that is inclusive of the author's specific population of interest (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer women).

The rationale and justification for attempting to conduct a systematic review of a body of literature that most likely, and in fact, does not exist lies in the author's intent to better understand _why_ the particular subject of women's use of violence in their same-gender romantic relationships remains a consistently lacking area of research. This is particularly justified in light of the long awaited-for validation of what was likely already known by a majority of members of the LGBTQ community, in general, which is that IPV does in fact exist within our communities.

The silence around the topic of IPV perpetrated by sexual minority women, therefore, is what most intrigues this researcher. What facilitates this silence? It _is_ a fallacy to assume the silence is maintained primarily by the community itself, as researchers within or closely tied to the LGBTQ community, including Claire Renzetti [@renzetti1992violent], Janice Ristock [@ristock2002no], and Ruthann Robson [@robson1990lavender], have published, relatively, extensively on the subject over the past few decades. Yet it remains that _no_ empirical research regarding IPV intervention nor prevention approaches appropriate for, relevant to, nor specifically inclusive of sexual minority women has been conducted by the very research field found on principles of diversity and innovation in research methodologies [i.e., Community Psychology; @fine2003participatory; @balcazar2004participatory; @maguire1987doing].
