A common factor characteristic among the formally reviewed literature is that each of the reviewed studies addressed research questions or hypotheses through multiple ecological levels of analysis (see Figures {@fig:keysnet} and {@fig:lvls}). This commonality is an artifact of the previously-described selection process conducted to determine which studies to include in the community-psychology-focused methodological review presented here (see `{{Section ???}}` and {+@fig:flowchart}). However, important differences and patterns exist regarding which and how many levels of analysis are involved in each of the reviewed studies. +@fig:keysnet provides both a visual description of the levels of analysis involved in each of the reviewed studies, as well as an analytic depiction of the relations among the reviewed studies based on the level(s) of analysis involved in each study. Several important pieces of information can be seen in this graphical representation, the first, and possibly most obvious, of which is that the vast majority of the reviewed literature can be characterized as crossing the individual and community levels of analysis, with slightly fewer studies 

and a relatively small minority of the reviewed studies can be characterized as intersecting from either the individual, community, or relationship level of analysis with the societal level of analysis.
