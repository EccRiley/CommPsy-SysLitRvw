`r tufte::newthought("Brief History of U.S. IPV Perpetrator Interventions.")` Efforts to address violence against women and in particular intimate partner and sexual violence in the United States began with an overall focus on treatment and tertiary intervention approaches, which, understandably, were primarily focused on addressing the immediate needs of victims.<!-- CITE -->  Until IPV perpetration became a crime in all 50 states, these efforts were in large part initiated and sustained on "grassroots" levels, connecting with and building upon one another toward efforts to affect more large-scale changes at the policy and structural levels. The criminalization of IPV perpetration was eventually followed by the enactment and enforcement of mandatory arrest laws across the country, which, while varied in scope and levels of implementation, essentially require police officers responding to calls deemed characteristic of domestic violence impose some level of punitive action against the accused offender in the situation. These laws were created and continue to be enforced under the goal of ensuring victims' safety. The U.S. Violence Against Women Act of 1994 shared a similarly victim-safety-centered purpose and, among a plethora of policy implications, was the first national-level policy providing at least a minimal amount of federal and state-level funding allocations specifically for developing and sustaining services for victims of IPV in each U.S. state. \ipel
