A **systematic review** answers a defined research question by collecting and summarising all empirical evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria.


Systematic reviews, just like other research articles, can be of varying quality. They are a significant piece of work (the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at York estimates that a team will take 9-24 months), and to be useful to other researchers and practitioners they should have:

clearly stated objectives with pre-defined eligibility criteria for studies
explicit, reproducible methodology
a systematic search that attempts to identify all studies
assessment of the validity of the findings of the included studies (e.g. risk of bias)
systematic presentation, and synthesis, of the characteristics and findings of the included studies


It is essential that each review is approached rigorously and with careful attention to detail. Plan carefully, and document everything. The consensus reporting guidelines for different study designs proposed by EQUATOR (\url{http://www.equator-network.org/}) are a useful starting point. PRISMA provides guidance on what you should include when reporting a systematic review.

# \textsc{Step 5:} Data extraction.

Devise a form tailored to your research question to ensure you obtain all relevant information from each of the included studies. You will need to pilot and refine this form before your final search. Ideally this form should be electronic to minimise transcription errors.

This will generally include details of study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention and setting, and results.

# \textsc{Step 6}: Critical appraisal of studies (quality assessment).

There is no consensus on the best way to assess study quality, but most methods encompass issues such as:

- Appropriateness of study design to the research objective
- Risk of bias
- Other issues related to study quality:
    - Choice of outcome measure
    - Statistical issues
    - Quality of reporting
    - Quality of the intervention
    - Generalisability

The consensus reporting guidelines for different study designs proposed by EQUATOR (\url{http://www.equator-network.org/} ) are a useful starting point, but note these are guidelines for reporting of original studies, NOT for assessment of study quality.

STROBE (\url{http://www.strobe-statement.org})  also provides useful guidelines for good reporting of observational research, including checklists of items that should be included in this type of research.

Useful resources for assessing quality of different study designs can be found here, and some specific examples are QUADAS for studies of diagnostic accuracy.

This article by Sanderson, Tatt and Higgins (2007) provides a review of the wide range of tools used to assess study quality. It does not recommend any specific tool for general use, but lists the domains which should be included [1) appropriate selection of participants 2) appropriate measurement of variables and 3) appropriate control of confounding, as well as considering design specific biases]. You may need to develop your own quality assessment tool, but do seek advice on the best method of quality assessment for your review.

This article by The Cochrane Collaboration describes a tool they developed for assessing risk of bias in random trials \url{http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d5928.full.pdf}

# \textsc{Step 7}: Data synthesis

You can present the data from the studies narratively and/or statistically (a meta-analysis). If studies are very heterogenous it may be most appropriate to summarise the data narratively and not attempt a statistical (meta-analytic) summary.

There are guidelines as to how to present a narrative synthesis [here](http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/SysRev/%21SSL%21/WebHelp/SysRev3.htm) (see section 1.3.5.1 - Narrative Synthesis). A statistical synthesis should include numerical and graphical presentations of the data, and also look at the strength and consistency of the evidence, and investigate reasons for any inconsistencies. See this [meta-analysis presentation](http://www.ccace.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/meta-analysis%20in%20cognitive%20ageing%20and%20epidemiology%20research.ppt?phpMyAdmin=UlK8xfSbayFQJAV7hgjO-sdYkp3) by Geoff Der.

# \textsc{Step 8}: Presenting results (writing the report)

 It is essential that your review is presented clearly, and in accordance with current best practice. For general guidance see the Equator network site [here](http://www.equator-network.org/resource-centre/library-of-health-research-reporting/).

The [PRISMA statement](http://www.prisma-statement.org/index.htm) and this related article by [Liberati et al. (2009)](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000100) provides very clear guidance on reporting of systematic reviews, including a flow chart of studies included, and there is useful advice on reporting meta-analysis of observational studies ([MOOSE](http://www.equator-network.org/index.aspx?o=1052)) at JAMA, 2000 PMID: [10789670](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dr=abstract&list_uids=10789670).
