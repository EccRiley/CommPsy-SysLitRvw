## Ecological systems theory and the Social Ecological Model

Ecological analysis provides a framework which observes, describes, and evaluates an individual's development, experiences, or behaviors in terms of the individual's multilevel and dynamic environment, or ecology, and the transactional relationships among the individual and one or more structural levels comprising the ecological system [@bronfenbrenner1977toward; @centers2015social; @barker1964ecological; @sarason1972creation]. The ecological model of human development originally posed by @bronfenbrenner1979ecology is comprised of five nested systems: (1) the _microsystem_ representing individuals and their interpersonal relationships, (2) the _mesosystem_ containing the settings in which two or more individuals' micro-systems interact (i.e., an individual's community), (3) the _exosystem_ representing the settings to which individuals have indirect contact such as a child's parent's workplace, (4) the macro-system comprising the structural elements of a society, and (5) the _chronosystem_ representing changes over time within each of the four nested systems. Each of these nested systems represent multiple levels of analysis to which research questions, hypotheses, and interventions can be applied. As such, it is not surprising that ecological systems theory and the social ecological model are cornerstones for the field of Community Psychology, as this theoretical framework necessitates research that looks beyond an individual in order to better capture and analyze the complexities that both influence and are influenced by individuals [@lounsbury2009introduction].

Ecological analysis is especially important to the design, implementation, and evaluation of community-based interventions [@trickett2009community; @trickett2009multilevel; @trickett2011water; @lounsbury2009introduction], including IPV-focused and closely related interventions and prevention approaches [@centers2013taking; @centers2015social; @baker2013lessons]. In particular, intimate partner violence has been somewhat well documented over the past few decades as a social and public health issue with causes, correlates, and consequences that span multiple levels of ecological analysis [@krug2002world; @centers2015social; @dahlberg2002violence]. In the early 2000s, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Division Violence and Injury Prevention developed and `{{began utilizing}}` a _Social-Ecological Model_ as a guiding framework intimate partner and sexual violence prevention efforts [@dahlberg2002violence; @centers2015social]. CDC's _Social-Ecological Model_ is a four-level adaptation of @bronfenbrenner1979ecology\'s five-system _Ecological Model of Human Development_ to evaluate and explain the causal factors of IPV, as well as a framework for mapping IPV intervention and prevention approaches to the _individual_, _relationship_, _community_, and _societal_ levels of analysis [see {+@fig:cdcsem}; @centers2015social; @dahlberg2002violence]. Within this analytic framework for IPV, the _individual_ level involves influential factors such as an individuals' family of origin, past trauma experiences, and personality characteristics. At the _relationship_ level are, of course, romantic or intimate relationships, but also the influences of individuals' interpersonal relationships with family, friends, peers, coworkers (etc.) on their identities, experiences, and behaviors. Contextual factors existing within an individual's _community_ include factors existing within or directly influenced by the settings in which interpersonal relationships and interactions among individuals occur, such as the economic status of the community, the stability, or instability, of community members and settings, and the availability, accessibility, and quality of community-based services. Additional _community_-level factors include the organizations and institutions to which an individual belongs or is affiliated with, such as sports teams, professional organizations (e.g., _`{{ the Society for Community Research and Action, American Psychological Association, etc.}}`_), school(s), and workplace(s). The community-level can be considered at `{{even further granular}}` levels of analysis when the sub-groups and sub-communities existing within larger settings are considered, such as the department within which an individual works at a multi-departmental institution, communities of individuals sharing the same college major, special interest groups within professional organizations (etc.). Finally, at the _societal_ level are the broad cultural and socio-political climates and structures constructed by a society's economic, health, education, and social policies, traditions, and rituals.

## Protective (versus risk) Factors & Community Health Promotion

Traditionally, psychological inquiry has focused on identifying and assessing _risk_ factors for negative outcomes on indicators for various psychological and behavioral phenomena at a primarily individual level of analysis. Whereas risk factors represent things that `{! compoundingly !}` _increase_ the likelihood of an negative outcomes among individuals, _protective_ factors are those which have an opposite effect by _decreasing_ the likelihood of negative outcomes. Importantly, the focus on protective, rather than on risk, factors among community scientists is `{! somewhat tied to !}` several core values of community-based and action research frameworks including the above-described focus on ecological contexts beyond and including the individual level of analysis, prioritizing (primary) prevention of social and public health problems rather than tertiary prevention/intervention, and an emphasis on strengths and resilience rather than on deficits across levels of analysis  <!-- TODO: CITE -->. The field of Community Psychology emerged, in large part, in resistance to the individual- and deficit-focused frameworks of traditional psychology [@kloos2012community, Chapter 2; @toro2005community; @maton2006community]. This foundation necessitated a corresponding focal shift toward factors, at any given level of analysis, that decrease the probability of or prevalence of a given social and/or public health problem (i.e., _protective_ factors). To date, however, IPV-related research within and outside of community-based and action research frameworks tends to examine risk and protective factors together, if protective factors are considered at all. That is, although the foundations of community science promote a focus on protective, versus risk, factors, the majority of community scientific research, along with research conducted outside of the ecological and community-based frameworks, risk remains the normative focus when it comes to analysis of factors influencing a given phenomenon, including, or especially, intimate partner and sexual violence perpetration and victimization.

## "The inextricable relationship of empowerment and politics" [@riger1993what, p. 283]

> "... despite our awareness of context for those we study, we do not always apply that understanding to ourselves" [@riger1993what, p. 279].

> > "... psychology's emphasis on the cognitive processes of the individual lead us to study individuals' _sense of_ empowerment rather than actual increases in power, thereby making the political personal" [@riger1993what, p. 280, _emph. in orig._].

The concept and theory of _empowerment_ is particularly relevant and influential to the content of the present review. As @riger1993what details, empowerment, as both a concept/construct and a theory, has played an increasingly key role in community-based and action-oriented research, yet embedded within this role are several problematic features inherent within empowerment as a construct and its implementation in intervention and prevention research. The problematic aspects of empowerment are especially relevant with regards to intimate partner and sexual violence, as both phenomena are innately tied power, but, supposedly, in opposing ways. Empowerment, as it has historically been defined and intended within community-psychological contexts, refers to the extent to which "people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their affairs" [@rappaport1987terms, p. 122]. Embedded within this definition are an individual's, organization's, or community's both _sense or perception_ of its own autonomy and its actual `{! exertion !}` of that autonomy. From a not-so-positive perspective, an empowered individual, for instance, can thus come to a psychological sense of feeling empowered and therefore within her or his own right to use that power _against_ another individual. On another level, `{! an organization may gain a sufficient level of a sense empowerment to determine that the organization, or its executive leadership, can decide what is best for the organization's constituency, which could result in the disempowerment of the individuals served by the organization !}` [@riger1993what].
