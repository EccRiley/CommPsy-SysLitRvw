# (B) Rationale <!--`(1 page)`-->

There are two core components of my action-oriented research framework: (1) a focus on developing and implementing innovative and inclusive research methodologies, data analytic approaches, and dissemination strategies; and (2) a diligent focus on the importance of critical reflexivity throughout the research process. The action-oriented and values-transparent community psychological research approach was born out of a resistance to research methodologies, social policies, and implementation practices that ultimately served to reinforce and/or strengthen social and economic inequalities. This foundation necessitates vigilance in critical reflexivity throughout and beyond the research process. The critical literature review I am proposing here is intended to serve this key characteristic of community psychology.
