# Major Area Paper Outline (2-3 pages)

I propose conducting a systematic critical review of research conducted with marginalized populations, with a specific focus on violence-related research with sexual minority women (SMW).^[[see relevance to dissertation topic](D-dissertationTopic.html)] The scope of reviewed research will include published work in the Community Psychology discipline, as well as research published in related fields such as Social and Clinical Psychology, Social Work, Public Health, Epidemiology, and Sociology. The critical review will attempt to map core components of community psychological theory and methodologies to the body of research available under the above-defined content and research discipline scopes. In particular, I am interested in evaluating the extent to which community psychological theory and methodologies are implemented, or not, in research related to the historically marginalized population of interest^[i.e., sexual minority women]. I am further interested in examining how the implementation of community psychological research has evolved over time since the origination of the field, as well as potential trajectories based on the current state of discourse within Community Psychology and closely related research and practice disciplines.
