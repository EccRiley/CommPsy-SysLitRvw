## CBPR & PAR


> "Participatory action research represents a stance within qualitative research methods --- an epistomology tat assumes knowledge is rooted in social relations and most powerful when produced collaboratively through action"  [@fine2003participatory, p. 173].

> > "PAR ... has typically been practiced within community-based social action projects with a commitment ot understanding, documenting, or evaluating the impact that social programs, social problems, or social movements bear on indivduals and communities"  [@fine2003participatory, p. 173].

> > "... at its core [PAR] articulates a recognition that knowledge is produced in collaboration and in action" [@fine2003participatory, p. 173].

> "[PAR] has been gradually gaining recognition in the social sciences promising strategy for actively involving research participants in the development and implementation of the research process while attempting to pursue socially relevant research issues" [@balcazar2004participatory, p. 17].

> "... [PAR] not only aims to empower individuals, but more important, it aims to facilitate higher order social, organizational, or political change" [@balcazar2004participatory, p. 17].

> "PAR combines social investigation, education, and social action to define and address social problems, particularly among disenfranchised and oppressed groups..." [@balcazar2004participatory, p. 17].

> "**[PAR] is both a research ideology and a strategy for conducting research**" [@balcazar2004participatory, p. 17; _emph. added_].

> > "As an ideology, PAR represents a set of beliefs regarding the role of social science research in alleviating social injustice and promoting community involvement in social change efforts" [@balcazar2004participatory, p. 17].

> "... [participatory] research was developed to change something about the specific situation right at that time, rather than, or as well as, later" [@senn2005you, p. 356].
> "Participatory research involves a very different level of involvement. A study can be said to be participatory when it requires the involvement of people from the group or community of interest in some or all stages of research" [@senn2005you, p. 360].
> > "@maguire1987doing suggested that 'participatory research combines three activities: investigation, education, and action' (p. 29)." [@senn2005you, p. 360].
> > "The _investigation_ part of the process is a 'social' investigation 'involving participation of oppressed and ordinary' people in problem posing and solving [@maguire1987doing, p. 29]" [@senn2005you, p. 360, _emph. in orig._].
> > "Both the participants in the study and the researchers are _educated_ in the process about the possible causes of the problem 'through collective discussion and interaction' [@maguire1987doing, p. 29]" [@senn2005you, p. 360, _emph. in orig._].
> > "... both the researchers and the participants 'join in solidarity to take collective _action_, both short and long term' [@maguire1987doing, p. 29, emphasis added]" [@senn2005you, p. 360, _emph. in orig._].
> > "The reasoning is clear. The people who are going to be affected by change efforts should be involved in directing that change, and mutual education will be necessary for that to occur" [@senn2005you, p. 360].


## GIS & PBM

> "Geographic information systems (GIS) are computer-based programs designed for the storage, visualization, analysis, and display of data that contain spatial components" [@lohmann2016geographic, p. 93].
> "The software for GIS allows for the _visual layering_ of geographic detail ... to assist in better understanding the relationships between spatial variables" [@lohmann2016geographic, p. 93, _emph. added_].
> > "The data generally take one of three forms: points ..., lines ..., and polygons. ... These categories contain some flexibility, however ..." [@lohmann2016geographic, p. 93].
> "GIS also has many analytic tools to extract information concerning the spatial variables. Among the more basic of these are the capacity to analyze the distance and area of any geographic variable" [@lohmann2016geographic, p. 93].
> > "More complex analytical operations involve _querying_ --- searching selected spacial variables for locating where specific criteria are met. ... By conducting queries for different spatial variables, areas of spacial correspondence can be located and analyzed" [@lohmann2016geographic, p. 93, _emph. added_].
