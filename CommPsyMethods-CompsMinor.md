1.	Define the method and discuss an example application of the method from the minor comps reading list.
2.	Review an application of the method to your own research area.
3.	Analyze the strengths and limitations of the method for use in community psychology research.
4.	Discuss how values and ethics in community psychology influence the utilization of the methodology, for example, in the choice of this of method, the sampling, etc.
