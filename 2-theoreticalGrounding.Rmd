# II. Theoretical Grounding

In a sense, the proposed review's theoretical grounding is best summarized in terms of the of the Community Psychology Practice Council's [_"Theory into Action Bulletin"_](http://www.scra27.org/what-we-do/practice/practice-council-initatives/theory-action-bulletin/)^[[Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA)](http://www.scra27.org/)]. The review will be grounded in theories related to action-oriented research and their applications [@chandler2003transforming; @brydon-miller2003why; @friedman-nimz2006blending; @kelly2004community; @noffke1997professional; @prilleltensky2001value-based; @prilleltensky1997values; @seidman2012emerging], as well as social and community psychological theories related to female same-sex intimate partner violence. In particular, I am interested in the intersections that exist across these theoretical, methodological, and problem-specific domains in terms of their actual applications and manifestations in various settings. Below is a list of theoretical and conceptual frameworks specifically guiding the proposed review.
