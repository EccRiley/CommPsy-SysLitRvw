    abstract={The concept of intergenerational transmission of intimate partner violence (IPV) has been an important topic of research. Experts have contended that this brutal path in which violence is transmitted to subsequent generations may be avoidable. This study examined whether public perceptions of the legal regulation of IPV and the certainty of sanction deter the prevalence of IPV. Data from 3,800 households were obtained from a nationwide survey conducted in South Korea. Due to a skewed distribution of the prevalence of IPV, this study applied a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model, which has been shown to address issues of skewed count variables. In addition, use of a ZIP model allowed us to examine factors associated with the occurrence and frequency of IPV. Results showed that child abuse experience and perceptions of the law were associated with the occurrence of IPV. Individuals who experienced child abuse were more likely to perpetrate IPV, whereas those aware of the law were less likely to perpetrate IPV. Witnessing IPV between parents was associated with an increased frequency of IPV. Results suggest that by increasing awareness of laws against domestic violence, IPV may be reduced or prevented.

    abstract={The Family Justice Center (FJC) model is an approach to assisting survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) that focuses on integration of services under one roof and co-location of staff members from a range of multidisciplinary agencies. Even though the FJC model is touted as a best practice strategy to help IPV survivors, empirical support for the effectiveness of this approach is scarce. The current article consolidates this small yet promising body of empirically based literature in a clinically focused review. Findings point to the importance of integrating additional resources into the FJC model to engage IPV survivors who have ambivalent feelings about whether to accept help, leave the abusive relationship, and/or participate in criminal justice processes to hold the offender accountable. One such resource, motivational interviewing (MI), holds promise in aiding IPV survivors with these decisions, but empirical investigation into how MI can be incorporated into the FJC model has yet to be published. This article, therefore, also integrates the body of literature supporting the FJC model with the body of literature supporting MI with IPV survivors. Implications for practice, policy, and research are incorporated throughout this review. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    abstract={Many states use a broad legal definition of domestic violence that includes intimate partner violence along with family violence, and it is from this broader conceptualization that the criminal justice system intervenes and often treats all types of offenders in the same way. This judicial response can include a mandate to attend a Batterer Intervention Program-type group, which does little to address violence that occurs outside of the "traditional" partner violence paradigm. In order to advance interventions for physical partner violence that adequately address both male and female perpetration, as well as the broader conceptualization of domestic violence, we must align definitions and standards among researchers, service providers, advocates, policymakers, and the public health and criminal justice systems. Examples of how this misalignment has stalled progress in offender treatment are discussed and a plan for enabling continued innovation in the field is presented.

    volume={31},
    number={8},
    pages={995-998},
    abstract={An ongoing discussion in the partner violence (PV) literature exists concerning the respective roles of perpetrator and victim. Most of it is gender based. The classical feminist argument is that women are victims of the violence and this is sustained by the social perception of them as victims. More recently increased recognition of mutual violence has taken place, calling into question the gender-based victim/perpetrator model. Recent research further calls into question this role differentiation through findings indicating that a majority of the protagonists in the PV drama view themselves as victims. A corollary to this controversy is that whether a man or a woman is the victim, the principal client in conventional intervention with PV is the woman. This paper will argue that the relevancy of gender-based role differentiation for most PV cases is not supported by recent data, and that incorporating an interactive perspective enables a more complex view than the classical victim/perpetrator one, and may improve our practice with PV populations.

The current paper discusses the evidence to date that illustrates the extent of the problem, including frequency within several samples and the severity of outcomes. It further argues that the only way to develop effective interventions is to acknowledge that many perpetrators may also be victims, and the need to understand the context in which the violence occurs.

SEPA had five sessions covering sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV prevention, partner communication, condom negotiation and use, and IPV. SEPA reduced IPV and alcohol intoxication, and improved partner communication compared with controls in a randomized trial with adult U.S. Hispanic women (SEPA, n = 274; delayed intervention control, n = 274) who completed structured interviews at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline. Parallel process latent growth curve models indicated that partner communication about HIV mediated the reduction in male-to-female IPV in SEPA, B = âˆ’0.78, SE = 0.14, p < .001, but alcohol intoxication did not, B = âˆ’0.15, SE = 0.19, p = .431. Male-to-female IPV mediated the intervention effect on female-to-male IPV, B = âˆ’1.21, SE = 0.24, p < .001. Skills building strategies originally designed to enhance women's communication with their partners about sexual risk behaviors also worked to reduce male-to-female IPV, which in turn reduced female-to-male IPV. These strategies could be integrated into other types of health promotion interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

Two hundred thirty-eight programs completed and returned the questionnaire, a response rate of 20%. The survey yielded descriptive data on respondent characteristics; program philosophy, structure, content, and service; client characteristics; treatment approach and adjunct services; and group facilitator views on intervention approaches and domestic violence policy and treatment standards. The programs varied in the extent to which they adhere to treatment approaches suggested by the empirical research literature. In addition, chi-square analyses were conducted on the associations between several factors. Significant correlations were found between respondent low level of education and adherence to a feminist- gendered program philosophy; respondent low level of education and use of a shorter assessment protocol; feminist-gendered program philosophy and incorrect facilitator knowledge about domestic violence; and feminist-gendered program philosophy and a program focus on power and control as the primary cause of domestic violence.

In this article, we present evidence on the prevalence, determinants, and impact of IPV across several sub-Saharan African countries interpreted against the backdrop of social ecological theory. We also describe prevention or intervention programs tested in different regions of Africa, selecting only those programs which were published in a journal outlet and which met a high criteria of implementation and methodology ( n = 7). Based on our review of the empirical literature, some risk factors for violence documented in Western societies are the same in Africa, including poverty, drinking, a past history of child abuse or posttraumatic stress disorder, and highly traditional gender role beliefs. Low education is also associated with IPV for both women and men. In Africa, partner abuse intersects with the HIV pandemic, making violence prevention especially urgent. African programs to prevent IPV are often incorporated with HIV prevention; community building and community engagement are emphasized more in Africa than in North America or Europe, which invoke more individually focused approaches. Some programs we review lowered HIV exposure in women; others contributed to reduced violence perpetration among men. The programs show sufficient promise to recommend replication and dissemination in sub-Saharan Africa. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    pages={35-42},
    abstract={Background: Interventions in health settings for intimate partner violence (IPV) are being increasingly recognised as part of a response to addressing this global public health problem. However, interventions targeting this sensitive social phenomenon are complex and highly susceptible to context. This study aimed to elucidate factors involved in women's uptake of a counselling intervention delivered by family doctors in the weave primary care trial (Victoria, Australia). Methods: We analysed associations between women's and doctors' baseline characteristics and uptake of the intervention. We interviewed a random selection of 20 women from an intervention group women to explore cognitions relating to intervention uptake. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded in NVivo 10 and analysed using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Results: Abuse severity and socio-demographic characteristics (apart from current relationship status) were unrelated to uptake of counselling (67/137 attended sessions). Favourable doctor communication was strongly associated with attendance. Eight themes emerged, including four sets of beliefs that influenced attitudes to uptake: (i) awareness of the abuse and readiness for help; (ii) weave as an avenue to help; (iii) doctor's communication; and (iv) role in providing care for IPV; and four sets of beliefs regarding women's control over uptake: (v) emotional health, (vi) doctors' time, (vii) managing the disclosure process and (viii) viewing primary care as a safe option. Conclusions: This study has identified factors that can promote the implementation and evaluation of primary care-based IPV interventions, which are relevant across health research settings, for example, ensuring fit between implementation strategies and characteristics of the target group (such as range in readiness for intervention). On practice implications, providers' communication remains a key issue for engaging women. A key message arising from this work concerns the critical role of primary care and health services more broadly in reaching victims of domestic violence, and providing immediate and ongoing support (depending on the healthcare context).

Bystander programs focus on equipping young adults with the skills to safely intervene when they witness behaviors that can result in dating abuse. This approach is promoted for its capacity both to transform community norms that contribute to dating abuse and to foster more positive social interactions among youth, however, there has been limited review of the literature on the outcomes of bystander programs. Therefore, this article provides an in-depth systematic literature review, which describes the content and program components of bystander programs and summarizes what is currently known about the impact of bystander interventions on participants' behaviors and attitudes. Results indicate that bystander programs are promising from the standpoint of increasing young adults' willingness to intervene and confidence in their ability to intervene when they witness dating or sexual violence, however, the utilization of actual bystander behaviors was less straightforward. Implications for prevention practice and for future research are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

This article presents a systematic narrative review of female IPV survivor perspectives on the changes brought about by IPV perpetrator programs. Fourteen databases and web search engines were searched and 16 articles reporting relevant qualitative findings were identified. Survivors often reported some level of positive change through their partner's engagement with a program, but the sustainability of this change is unclear and there was also some negative feedback. From the survivors' perspective, key barriers to perpetrator change include alcohol dependency, mental health challenges, relationship dynamics, and their family of origin. Mechanisms by which perpetrators are held to account, namely, survivor validation and judicial measures, were seen as central to the change process. Survivors perceived changes in perpetrator behavior (the use of conflict interruption techniques and new communication skills) and changes in perpetrators' belief systems (adopting new perspectives). Changes in belief systems were associated with more complete desistence from violence and would appear more difficult to effect. The review highlights the complexity in this field, which is discussed by the authors with reference to practice, policy, and research.

Method: The adaptation process was guided by the ADAPT-ITT framework and data collected from directors, direct client service providers, and residents of 2 domestic violence shelters located in urban areas, as well as topical experts. Results: Eleven of 12 shelter staff (92%) reported that HIV interventions had never been implemented at their shelter and 64% reported they had not provided residents with educational brochures about HIV prevention. Changes made to adapt SISTA for this population and enhance the implementation of the intervention included reducing the intervention's duration; adding education about the intersection of IPV, substance use, and HIV; and adding an HIV risk assessment and safety plan. Conclusions: Next steps will include implementing the adapted intervention and evaluating its perceived acceptability and efficacy, and assessing whether contextual factors influence the intervention's implementation.

While we ultimately offered short-term IPV services to controls, we faced additional challenges related to sustaining services beyond the "short-term" and posttrial. Conclusion: Studies evaluating community-level violence interventions, including those combined with HIV reduction strategies, are limited yet critical for developing evidence-based approaches for effectively preventing IPV. Although CRTs are a promising design, further guidance is needed to implement trials that avoid introducing tensions between validity of findings, researchers' responsibilities to protect participants, and equitable distribution of CRT benefits.

    abstract={We used data from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, a prospective longitudinal survey of more than 400 males in the United Kingdom followed from age 8 to age 48 to investigate intimate partner violence (IPV) and its association with psychopathy. We investigated the differences in psychopathy scores between those men who were convicted of violence, those who were involved in both extra- and intra-familial violence, and those who committed IPV only. We also considered whether these generally violent men had poorer life success overall with regard to their drinking and drug taking, depression, and other mental disorders. Our findings suggest that those men who are violent both within and outside the home (the generally violent men) are distinguished from those who commit violent crimes outside the home and those who are involved in IPV within the home only. The differences appear to be more in degree than in kind. These findings are discussed with a focus on whether specific interventions are required for those who commit IPV or whether early intervention should be focused on violent behavior in general.

    journal={Journal of Family Violence},
    abstract={Intimate partner violence remains a persistent social and clinical problem with far-reaching effects for families and communities. With considerable debate surrounding its treatment, two main approaches are commonly described in outcome research and clinical practice literature: gender-specific (e.g. male-only groups) and systemic approaches (e.g. conjoint treatment for couples). Proponents of the former approach cite the risks of systemic approaches that unwittingly sustain the oppression of women, while proponents of the latter highlight the importance of addressing reciprocal patterns of violence and cumulative sources of stress upon a couple. In this review, the author describes some of the issues pertinent to this debate, highlighting areas of risk and hope. The combined use of gender-specific and conjoint treatment may be beneficial for some couples under particular circumstances. The paper closes with considerations for conducting conjoint treatment.

    abstract={An increased understanding of the cognitive characteristics of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Sex Offenders would have implications for clinical intervention and risk assessment in this distinctive offending behaviour group. The improved understanding of cognitions in violent offenders, sex offenders, and IPV offenders has led to the development and implementation of specific offender behaviour programmes taking these cognitive characteristics into account. Recently, empirical investigations have focused on qualitative exploration of cognition to propose implicit theories (ITs), that is distinct sets of schemas that offenders hold in relation to themselves, the world, and others. The current paper utilises Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to explore cognition in 11 Intimate Partner Sex Offenders. Five superordinate and 14 subthemes were identified, which are representative of Implicit Theories present in this specific offender group. These ITs are discussed in relation to other offending behaviour groups in addition to their clinical implications in the development of effective interventions and risk assessment tools.

    abstract={Batterer intervention programs are mostly failing to protect victims of intimate partner violence; yet, there is a dearth of research that examines the treatment intervention as a predictor for program dropout. A systematic review of offenders' attrition and recidivism rates throughout the literature found that current interventions typically mandated by criminal justice policymakers, like the Duluth Model and Cognitive Behavior Therapy, are largely ineffective for perpetrators of all racial/ethnic groups. However, they are particularly problematic for Black males who are disproportionately remanded to treatment and more likely to drop out, which elevates their risk of reoffending at increased lethality. Current interventions account for patriarchy; however, there is a fundamental mismatch, specifically since the interlocking nature of systemic racism, along with its societal effects that include social, political and economic inequality that Black males dually experience are largely ignored. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of strengths-based intervention models, like Goal Setting, to account for their needs. Although limited, available research reflects promising outcomes and may point toward developing more strengths-based interventions. Fixing the batterer system is critical to reducing intimate partner violence, particularly since Black women are murdered by their intimate partner at rates that parallel Black males' program dropout.

Our objective was to develop a Web-based intervention to address violence and drug use among women patients in the emergency department (ED). Methods: The intervention was developed in a 5-step process: (1) Initial intervention development based on selected theoretical frameworks; (2) In-depth interviews with the target population; (3) Intervention adaptation, with iterative feedback from further interviews; (4) Beta testing and review by an advisory committee of domestic violence advocates; (5) Acceptability and feasibility testing in a small open trial. Results: Themes supported the selection of motivational interviewing (MI) and empowerment models but also guided major adaptations to the intervention, including the introduction of videos and a more robust booster phone call. Participants in the open trial reported high scores for satisfaction, usability, and consistency with essential elements of MI. Conclusions: This qualitative work with our target population of women in the ED with SUD experiencing IPV underscored the importance of connection to peers and empathetic human contact. We developed an acceptable and feasible intervention distinct from prior ED-based brief interventions for substance-using populations.

The short- and long-term health effects of violence can be disabling if left undetected. A recent World Health Organization (WHO) report indicates that Africa is one of the regions with the highest prevalence of physical and/or sexual IPV among ever-partnered women. Routine screening for IPV can potentially improve the care and treatment of women suffering from violence. Although routine screening is commonplace in European and American countries, health systems barriers in developing countries have deterred introduction of this practice. Results from this feasibility study indicate that providers are willing and able to incorporate IPV screening into their practice and that IPV screening in a variety of health care settings in a public hospital is feasible and welcomed by clients. Referral uptake by women suffering from IPV was low compared with provider referral rates, but ways in which referral and management services could be improved were identified.

In the first part of the commentary, we provide a brief overview of research, policies, and programs aimed at reducing violence against AI/AN women. In the second part, we present 3 recommendations for an expanded research agenda. The first recommendation is to promote participatory research on risk and protective factors to inform the development of culturally appropriate, strength-based and resilience interventions. The second recommendation is to increase applications of life course theories and examine the interconnectedness between intimate partner violence (IPV) and violence exposures that occur during childhood and older adulthood. The third recommendation is to conduct more studies on social and historical determinants of violence, with an emphasis on community and societal factors. Conclusions: Increased applications of theoretical frameworks may shed light on social, economic, historical, and cultural factors associated with violence against AI/AN women. Incorporating the factors in IPV prevention and intervention programs requires active participation and indigenous knowledge from AI/AN scholars, leaders, advocates, and communities. Diverse stakeholders play an important role in promoting the use of cultural strengths to improve the health and safety of AI/AN women and families.

It has been identified that men can, and do stop using, or desist from, IPV although it is unclear how this process of change develops. This article introduces a conceptual model to outline how the process of desistance evolves and what it encompasses. Using thematic analysis of interview data from partner-violent men, survivors, and treatment facilitators, the resulting model demonstrates that the process of change is a dynamic one where men's use of, and cessation from, violence needs to be understood within the context of each individual's life. Three global themes were developed: (a) lifestyle behaviors (violent): what is happening in the men's lives when they use violence; (b) catalysts for change: the triggers and transitions required to initiate the process of change; and (c) lifestyle behaviors (non-violent): what is different in the men's lives when they have desisted from IPV. The purpose of this model is to offer a framework for service providers to assist them to manage the process of change in partner-violent men.

Goals of the current study were threefold: (a) assess the perceived need for a military-specific IPA program among Veterans Administration and community domestic violence (DV) program providers; (b) conduct a pilot study to examine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of SAH in a sample drawn from a diverse, multicultural community; and (c) conduct focus groups to obtain participant feedback on the SAH protocol. Findings from the provider survey suggested a need for specialty programs to treat military personnel who perpetrate IPA of mildtomoderate severity. Results of the SAH pilot study ( n = 6) indicated decreased psychological aggression and increased anger control from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Focus group feedback indicated participants found the program to be helpful and appropriate across a wide variety of ethno-cultural variables. As more service members and Veterans of the Iraq/Afghanistan war era reintegrate into our communities, it will become increasingly important for providers in both private and public sectors of care to understand the unique needs of this treatment population, and to have access to effective IPA treatment programs.

    abstract={Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a critical public health problem that requires clear and testable etiological models that may translate into effective interventions. While alcohol intoxication and a pattern of heavy alcohol consumption are robust correlates of IPV perpetration, there has been limited research that examines the mediating mechanisms of how alcohol potentiates IPV. We provide a theoretical and methodological framework for researchers to conceptualize how alcohol intoxication causes IPV, and propose innovative laboratory methods that directly test mediational mechanisms. We conclude by discussing how these innovations may lead to the development of interventions to prevent or reduce alcohol-related IPV.

    abstract={Objective: Because of its high prevalence and serious consequences for victims, sexual violence is a significant problem on college campuses. Sexual assault prevention programs based on the bystander intervention model have been shown to be effective; however, current programs are limited in terms of ease of distribution. To address this issue, we developed and evaluated "Take Care," an online bystander intervention program. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evaluation of an online bystander intervention program designed to prevent sexual violence. Method: Ninety-three participants (80.6% female, 19.4% male) recruited from social psychology classes at a midsize university were randomly assigned to view 1 of 2 online programs: Take Care or a control program on study skills. Before viewing the programs, participants completed measures of bystander behaviors and feelings of efficacy for performing such behaviors. Measures were administered again postintervention and at a 2-month follow-up assessment. Results: Participants who viewed Take Care reported greater efficacy for engaging in bystander behaviors at postintervention and 2 months after treatment, compared with those who viewed the control program. In addition, participants who viewed Take Care reported performing relatively more bystander behaviors for friends at the 2-month follow-up assessment, compared with participants who viewed the control program. Conclusions: These results suggest that sexual violence prevention programs may be effectively adapted to an online format.

    pages={325-336},
    abstract={Objective: To provide the first nationally representative data on service contact, police or advocate best practices, and helpseeking obstacles for family violence that involved exposure to children. Method: A nationally representative sample of 517 family violence incidents drawn from the 4,503 respondents to the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence II. Results: A range of 10 best practices were offered in 13â€“58% of police contacts and 34â€“97% of advocate contacts. Most police best practices were associated with increased likelihood of arrest. Referrals and information about restraining orders and shelter were associated with victim-perpetrator separation. There was marked case attrition for all criminal justice services, including reporting to police, in-person police responding, arrest, convictions, and incarceration. Only 10 cases resulted in jail time. Counter to hypothesis, higher rates of some police best practices were associated with lower likelihood of advocate contact. Also unexpectedly, higher rates of some obstacles, such as lack of transportation, were associated with higher use of police services. Conclusions: Referral to specific resources is recommended as a focus of crisis intervention efforts. Some family's needs may be served by a single provider if best practices are used. Some obstacles may influence which services are sought rather than depress helpseeking altogether. These nationally representative data can be used as benchmarks for program evaluations and needs assessments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    volume={22},
    pages={18-25},
    abstract={The term 'interpersonal violence' is used to refer to a wide range of violent acts, including intimate partner violence, child abuse and stranger assaults. Two extensive reviews of interventions to reduce or prevent interpersonal violence published between 1950 and 2008 identified a large literature base reflecting the extensive collective effort of violence researchers over the past 50 years. However, neither review was able to meaningfully synthesize sub-group data due to the high degree of heterogeneity present. This paper interrogates this apparent contradiction by examining three examples of predefined sub-group analyses from these reviews. None of the chosen examples produced groups of studies with adequate homogeneity for meaningful meta-analysis and synthesis, indicating that the violence research literature, while extensive, is currently too heterogeneous to be used to inform policy related to the most appropriate interventions suitable for evidence-based practice. If the literature cannot become more focused via a major topic prioritization exercise, an alternative solution to this problem may be to adopt a realist synthesis approach to determine what works, for whom, and in what context.

Results indicated that women reporting higher levels of psychological abuse reported less negative attitudes toward IPV, engaged in less-active coping responses, and had lower NMRE. Psychological abuse was a significant predictor of avoidant coping, while NMRE significantly predicted both active and avoidant coping. In addition, the interaction of NMRE Ã— Psychological abuse added incremental prediction of avoidant coping. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

In an experimental study, undergraduates read a fictitious article from a newspaper describing an IPV episode of a man hitting his wife and accusing her of cheating on him. According to the experimental condition, they then read that the victim either had or had not admitted the infidelity. Participants then judged the victim on an infra-humanization scale and expressed their willingness to provide help and support to the victim herself as if they were a neighbor witnessing the attack. Results showed that a victim admitting an affair with another man (admission condition) elicited lower perceived humanness and lower willingness to provide help than a victim denying such adultery (no admission condition). Moreover, targets' perceived humanness mediated the effect of contextual features on participants' willingness to provide help to the victim. Results are discussed in terms of victim blaming, and practical implications for prevention strategies are presented.

    volume={48},
    number={4},
    pages={372-383},
    abstract={Background: An Internet safety decision aid was developed to help abused women understand their risk for repeat and near-lethal intimate partner violence, clarify priorities related to safety, and develop an action plan customized to these priorities. Purpose: To test the effectiveness of a safety decision aid compared with usual safety planning (control) delivered through a secure website, using a multistate RCT design. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of the safety decision aid in reducing decisional conflict after a single use by abused women. Design: RCT referred to as Internet Resource for Intervention and Safety (IRIS). Setting/participants: Abused women who spoke English ( n = 708) were enrolled in a four-state RCT. Intervention: The intervention was an interactive safety decision aid with personalized safety plan; the control condition was usual safety planning resources. Both were delivered to participants through the secure study website. Main outcome measures: This paper compares women's decisional conflict about safety: total decisional conflict and the four subscales of this measure (feeling: uninformed, uncertain, unsupported, and unclear about safety priorities) between intervention/control conditions. Data were collected from March 2011 to May 2013 and analyzed from January to March 2014. Results: Immediately following the first use of the interactive safety decision aid, intervention women had significantly lower total decisional conflict than control women, controlling for baseline value of decisional conflict ( p = 0.002, effect size = 0.12). After controlling for baseline values, the safety decision aid group had significantly greater reduction in feeling uncertain ( p = 0.006, effect size = 0.07) and in feeling unsupported ( p = 0.008, effect size = 0.07) about safety than the usual safety planning group. Conclusions: Abused women randomized to the safety decision aid reported less decisional conflict about their safety in the abusive intimate relationship after one use compared to women randomized to the usual safety planning condition.

    volume={30},

    pages={400-419},
    abstract={Intimate partner violence (IPV) accounts for up to 50% of all calls to police. In an effort to standardize arrest criteria, mandatory arrest laws were established. It is unclear whether subsequent increased rates of female arrest are due to greater recognition of female IPV perpetrators or of women acting in self-defense. This study aims to understand the context and consequences of IPV-related arrest from perspectives of women arrested in a single metropolitan area. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with women arrested and court-ordered to attend IPV education groups at a women's shelter in the Northeast United States. Interviews addressed circumstances surrounding arrest, experience with past violence, and reasoning regarding use of partner violence. Two researchers independently coded transcripts and met to iteratively refine the code and review transcripts for themes. Eighteen women were interviewed. Major themes that emerged were as follows: (a) Women's use of violence occurred within the context of their own victimization; (b) the arrest included a complex interplay between subject, partner, and police; (c) women perceived police arrest decisions to be based on a limited understanding of context; and (d) women experienced both positive and negative consequences of arrest. Many relationships did not fall under the traditional victim/perpetrator construct. Rather, women's use of violence evolved, influenced by prior experiences with violence. More appropriate methods must be developed for making arrest decisions, guiding justice system responses, and developing interventions for couples experiencing IPV. Recognition that women's use of partner violence often represented either a retaliatory or self-defensive gesture within the context of prior victimization suggests that victims' interventions should not only focus on empowerment but also provide skills and strategies to avoid temptation to adopt aggression as a primary method of self-protection.

They are more likely to have long developmental histories of violence, hold entrenched attitudes, and utilize knowledge about the effects of intimidation to avoid detection.

Participants were interviewed at baseline and immediately following the intervention or waitlist period, representing an elapsed time of approximately 5 weeks. After controlling for relevant demographic variables, violence severity, and mental health, women showed significantly more change in their positive parenting scores if they were in the treatment condition. No significant differences were found between the treatment and comparison groups in their negative parenting practices change scores.

    abstract={Research on intimate partner violence (IPV) has increased over the past two decades, however empirical research on potential harm to participants is limited. The aim of this study was to assess whether 272 women involved in a general practice based IPV intervention trial ( weave) reported more benefit or harm, whether this differed by intervention or comparison group, and what types of benefit and harm were reported. Feedback was obtained via adapted Consequences of Screening Tool, visual analogue scale and open-ended question in baseline, 6-month, 12-month and 24-month surveys (all participants), and semi-structured interviews (subset of 28 participants). Participants in both the intervention and comparison groups tended to respond positively on all quantitative items, although on a number of items, the intervention group responded even more positively. At 6 and 12months, 51.1% and 54.7% of all participants, respectively, reported their quality of life as becoming better and over 40% of women at each time-point, indicated they felt more positive about themselves as a result of some aspect of their involvement in weave. 42% of all participants reported their home lives becoming less difficult. In qualitative analyses, positive themes identified were altruism, value, evaluation of relationship, validation, self-awareness, empowerment, positive reinforcement, catharsis, motivation to seek help, and response to the research process. Negative themes identified were short-term emotional reactions, long-term emotional reactions, recall, retraumatization and minimization. Many participants indicated short-term negative emotions had been balanced by longer-term positive benefits. Further research is needed regarding characteristics and experiences of the small minority of participants who did not report positive benefit.

    abstract={Intimate partner violence (IPV) is endemic in societies around the world and detrimental to women's wellbeing. Abused women are frequent users of health services. Despite the recent World Health Organization guidelines on IPV and sexual violence, we need more evidence on effective responses to women in health care settings. Developing robust evidence with potential to inform policy and clinical practice requires greater clarity and consistency across studies in the selection and use of outcomes to evaluate interventions. Drawing on systematic reviews and individual trials aimed at reducing abuse and improving women's health, we discuss critical issues in respect of outcomes. We discuss primary, secondary, intermediate and proxy outcomes and measures used to evaluate interventions for women who experience IPV. We offer recommendations about which outcomes to assess and approaches to doing so within the context of trials in health care settings.

However, previous research has yet to clarify and resolve contention regarding whether motives for IPV are gender-neutral or gender-specific. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare motives for physical IPV perpetration among a sample of men ( n = 90) and women ( n = 87) arrested for domestic violence and court referred to batterer intervention programs. Results demonstrated that the most frequently endorsed motives for IPV by both men and women were self-defense, expression of negative emotions, and communication difficulties. With the exception of expression of negative emotions and retaliation, with women endorsing these motives more often than men, there were no significant differences between men and women's self-reported reasons for perpetrating physical aggression. The implications of these findings for future research and intervention programs are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    abstract={Women in rural communities who are exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) have fewer resources when seeking help due to limited health services, poverty, and social isolation. Rural primary care physicians may be key sources of care for IPV victims. The objective of this study was to assess the opinions and practices of primary care physicians caring for rural women with regard to IPV identification, the scope and severity of IPV as a health problem, how primary care providers respond to IPV in their practices, and barriers to optimized IPV care in their communities. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 19 internists, family practitioners, and obstetrician-gynecologists in rural central Pennsylvania. Interview transcripts were analyzed for major themes. Most physicians did not practice routine screening for IPV due to competing time demands, lack of training, limited access to referral services as well as low confidence in their effectiveness, and concern that inquiry would harm the patientâ€“doctor relationship. IPV was considered when patients presented with symptoms of mood, anxiety, or somatic disorders. Responses to IPV included validation, danger assessment, safety planning, referral, and follow-up planning. Perceived barriers to rural women seeking help for IPV included traditional gender roles, lower education, economic dependence on the partner, low self-esteem, and patient reluctance to discuss IPV. To overcome barriers, physicians created a "safe sanctuary" to discuss IPV and suggested improved public health education and referral services. Interventions to improve IPV-related care in rural communities should address barriers at multiple levels, including both physicians' and patients' comfort with discussing IPV. Provider training, community education, and improved access to referral services are key areas in which IPV-related care should be improved in rural communities. Our data support routine screening to better identify IPV and a more pro-active stance toward screening and counseling.

    abstract={Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a crucial public health concern with substantial detrimental effects, including poorer physical and mental health as well as increased difficulties accessing formal services. Most research to date has focused on frequencies, barriers, and facilitators of service use among IPV survivors. However, what remains poorly understood is the perspectives of IPV survivors on their experiences of accessing multiple services after leaving the abusive situations. To answer this, six one-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with survivors using expanded definition of "services," which included social services, shelters, health care, police, legal assistance, and so forth. Data were analyzed using Constant Comparison. Four resulting themes were (a) Positive Aspects, (b) Negative Aspects, (c) Impact of Experiences With Services, and (d) Contextual Factors. Within each of these categories, several sub-categories emerged and are discussed within the context of the literature and recommendations are made for improving services for IPV survivors.

    abstract={This paper reviews the significant challenges that are involved in the development of services for perpetrators of intimate partner violence who are in prison. It is suggested that difficulties in accurately identifying intimate partner violence, reliably assessing risk of re-offense, and in identifying offending behavior programs that meet the specific needs of prisoners have limited the development of services in this area. As a result it is argued that unique and complex victim related issues that arise during incarceration and post-release are not adequately recognized in current correctional assessment and case management systems. Four avenues for future research and service development in this area are identified, with a view to developing the role that correctional services have to play in preventing intimate partner violence.

    pages={2172-2191},
    abstract={While there is a growing body of research on intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by the housed youth population, a limited amount is known about IPV experienced by homeless youth. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined how homeless youths' experience of IPV is related to their social network, even though the social networks of homeless youth have been shown to be significant indicators of health and mental health. The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between IPV, gender, and social networks among a sample of 386 homeless youth in Los Angeles, California. Results revealed that one fifth of the sample experienced IPV in the past year. Stratified regression models revealed that IPV was not significantly related to any measure of male social networks; however, females who experienced IPV had more male friends (Î² = 2.03, SE = 0.89, p < .05) than females who did not experience IPV. Female homeless youth who witnessed family violence during childhood had more male friends (Î² = 2.75, SE = 1.08, p < .05), but those who experienced sexual abuse during childhood had fewer male friends (Î² = âˆ’2.04, SE = 0.93, p < .05). Although there was no significant difference in the rate of IPV victimization across genders, the context of this abuse appears to be drastically different. The results suggest that females with more male friendships are at greater risk for exposure to IPV. To date, there are few effective youth-targeted IPV prevention programs and none have been shown to be effective with homeless youth. These results provide insight into future program development.

The study also examined participants' views of the benefits and harms of IPV inquiry. Results showed that the intervention increased IPV inquiry, discussion, and disclosure compared to usual care. Women in intervention clinics made fewer doctor visits, but also received more prescriptions over time. The groups did not differ in change in physical violence, use of safety plans and strategies, connection to the community, patient satisfaction, or quality of health. Over the course of the study, both the intervention and usual care groups adopted more safety behaviors and experienced less violence, suggesting that participating in research interviews may have constituted an unintentional intervention. Small sample size ( N = 34), low participation rate (32 %) and attrition (35 %) call for caution in interpreting these results.

    abstract={This study tested the effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention for reducing women's exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV). One-hundred and twenty women who had experienced IPV in the last 2 years were assigned to a treatment or comparison group condition using a sequential assignment paradigm. Treatment group participants completed a 10-session evidence-based intervention, the Mom's Empowerment Program, designed to treat common mental health issues after exposure to IPV and assist women with access to resources. Women were interviewed at baseline and at 6- to 8-month follow-up regarding the level of IPV they had experienced. Violence victimization significantly decreased for women in both conditions between the baseline interview and the 6- to 8-month follow-up. Participation in treatment was related to an augmented effect of violence reduction such that women participating in the intervention experienced greater declines in violence than those who did not participate in the treatment program. These findings support the hypothesis that this treatment model, which combines mental health and advocacy services, is effective in reducing violence revictimization risk for women exposed to IPV.

A hierarchical regression analysis showed that motivational factors accounted for the greatest proportion of the variance in self-reported propensity. Specifically, personal norm (i.e., an individual's felt obligation to intervene) was the strongest individual predictor, followed by affective response (i.e., the extent to which an individual responds to IPV with negative emotions). Although cognitive factors explained only a small portion of the variance, the propensity to intervene was significantly higher for respondents who perceived IPV as a prevalent issue and who did not view the perpetrator as responsible for the solution of IPV. The findings suggest that attempts to facilitate public intervention should target specific, rather than general, aspects of public norms and beliefs about IPV.

The underlying philosophy of Duluth-based interventions is evaluated as well as the treatment outcome literature for this intervention. There is very little evidence to justify the current legal system practice of mandating all perpetrators to psychological interventions addressing power and control issues. A literature review of scientific findings with IPV perpetrators and the issues that need to be taken into consideration in developing alternative evidence-based interventions are presented. The evidence seems to favor heterogeneity and not homogeneity with respect to both type of perpetrator and type of violence. Assessment and treatment suggestions are made to address this evidence-based heterogeneity and a call is made to those responsible to stop perpetuating the practice of mandating all perpetrators to attend a single intervention for which there is very limited evidence of effectiveness. About two-thirds of male perpetrators of IPV cease being physically aggressive against their partners if they are assigned to a probation officer, but there is minimal evidence that the addition of a Duluth-based intervention makes perpetration less likely.

As with any research, but particularly with respect to studies on a controversial topic such as genetic correlates of IPV, extreme caution should be taken prior to generalizing results or deriving any practical applications from the data. Clearly, replication and extension of the findings in other populations is essential. Ultimately, we believe that it is worth pursuing this line of work given the possible contributions it may make to understanding the etiology, prevention, and treatment of IPV in the future. Finding solutions to IPV will require the collaboration of a diverse group of constituents from many disciplines. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

We obtained DNA from 97 men in batterer intervention programs in the state of Rhode Island. In the full sample, the CGS was significantly associated with physical and psychological aggression and injuries caused to one's partner, even after controlling for the effects of alcohol problems, drug problems, age, and length of relationship. Two of the men in the sample likely had Klinefelter's syndrome, and analyses were repeated excluding these two individuals, leading to similar results.

    abstract={Domestic violence (DV) continues to constitute an enormous public health problem in the United States. Knowledge and understanding of the complexities involved in DV has grown significantly in recent years revealing a need for providers who have broad training in a variety of legal, safety, developmental, and clinical issues that face families impacted by DV. This article reviews current approaches to training and the ability of such methods to adequately prepare providers. There are no national standards for providers at any level from DV advocates to batterer interventionists, to clinicians with the required hours of training in most states at an alarmingly low level. Few states require cross training for those working as victim advocates or batterer interventionists. The systems that currently provide segregated and limited training create silos of service that are less effective. A proposed set of standards and training guidelines are proposed for DV advocates, batterer interventionists, and clinicians along with a discussion of the implications of such standards for the field.

In cases where there actually was suspicion (based on specific evidence and markers) or where there was no concealment of such type of violence, 52.3 % of the physicians did not inform the victims about the risks this situation posed to them, 89.8 % did not mention their obligation to denounce the case (as it is foreseen by the Portuguese law), and the number of injuries they described was lower than the one described in the forensic medical reports.

    abstract={Gender-based violence, which includes sexual and intimate partner violence against women, is prevalent worldwide, prompting calls for primary prevention programs which engage men and boys in changing social norms that condone violence against women. Bystander intervention efforts which encourage males to say something to stop peers from enacting disrespectful and abusive behaviors toward females are a promising strategy for promoting non-violent, gender-equitable attitudes and behaviors. An evaluation of "Parivartan"â€”a U.S. program called "Coaching Boys Into Men" adapted for urban India cricket teamsâ€”was conducted in Mumbai, India. Baseline and 12 month follow-up surveys were administered to 309 male cricket athletes aged 10 to 16 years in 46 urban middle schools in Mumbai, India (27 intervention, 19 control). Athletes whose coaches were trained in the program demonstrated greater improvements in gender-equitable attitudes compared to athletes whose coaches provided standard coaching only. Marginally significant improvements were seen in reduction of negative bystander behavior. Violence prevention programs which utilize coaches as positive messengers for respect and non-violence may be a useful addition to global prevention efforts to reduce violence against women.

    pages={218-230},
    abstract={Changes in social policy are often pursued with the goal of reducing a social problem by improving prevention efforts, intervention program practices, or participant outcomes. State legislative standards for intimate partner violence intervention programs have been adopted nearly universally across the US, however, we do not know whether such standards actually achieve the intended goal of affecting programs' policies and practices. To assess the effect that batterer intervention program (BIP) standards have on policies and practices of programs, this study used longitudinal surveys collected as part of an ongoing evaluation conducted from 2001 to the present to compare intervention program ( N = 74) characteristics and practices at three time points before and after the adoption of standards in Oregon. Analyses were conducted to examine all BIPs in Oregon at each time point, as well as change among a subset of programs in existence at all survey assessments. Results indicate that across all programs, the use of mixed gender group co-facilitation increased by 14 % between 2004 and 2008, while program length increased by approximately 12 weeks. However, other practices such as programs' coordination with community partners were unchanged. Analyses of within-program change revealed fewer differences, with only program length increasing significantly over the three assessments. These and other findings indicate that while standards affected program length as intended, other practices commonly addressed by legislative standards remained unchanged. The findings provide needed information regarding programs' compliance with components of the standards, the potential need for compliance monitoring, and the potential impact of state standards on program effectiveness and on the prevalence of intimate partner violence.

    abstract={Drawing on social disorganization theory, the current study examined the extent to which community-level poverty rates and collective efficacy influenced individual reports of intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration, victimization, and bystander intervention among a sample of 178 young adults (18â€“24; 67.4 % women) from 16 rural counties across the eastern US who completed an online survey that assessed demographic information, IPV perpetration, victimization, bystander intervention, and collective efficacy. We computed each county's poverty rate from the 2007â€“2011 American Community Survey. Generalized estimating equations demonstrated that after controlling for individual-level income status, community-level poverty positively predicted IPV victimization and perpetration for both men and women. Collective efficacy was inversely related to IPV victimization and perpetration for men; however, collective efficacy was unrelated to IPV victimization and perpetration for women. Whereas IPV bystander intervention was positively related to collective efficacy and inversely related to individual-level income status for both men and women, community-level poverty was unrelated to IPV bystander intervention for both men and women. Overall, these findings provide some support for social disorganization theory in explaining IPV among rural young adults, and underscore the importance of multilevel IPV prevention and intervention efforts focused around community-capacity building and enhancement of collective efficacy.

    abstract={Context: Primary care providers are uniquely positioned to respond to patients' disclosure of intimate partner violence (IPV). However, the research on primary careâ€“based IPV interventions has not been systematically synthesized, making it difficult for providers, policymakers, and researchers to understand how to effectively intervene in the primary care setting. This systematic review summarizes primary careâ€“based interventions for patients experiencing IPV. Evidence acquisition: PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched from their start through September 2012; this search was augmented by bibliographic review and consultation with experts. Eligible studies included English-language, peer-reviewed articles that assessed patient-level impact of IPV interventions that originated from patients' visits to a primary care provider. Evidence synthesis: Of 80 potentially eligible studies, 17 met eligibility criteria. The majority of interventions recruited women from reproductive care sites. Interventions tended to be brief, delivered by nonphysicians, and focused on empowerment, empathetic listening, discussion of the cycle of violence and safety, and referral to community-based resources. Thirteen studies demonstrated at least one intervention-related benefit. Six of 11 articles measuring IPV persistence found reductions in future violence; two of five measuring safety-promoting behaviors found increases; and six of ten measuring IPV/community resource referrals found enhanced use. Some studies also documented health improvements. Conclusions: The majority of studies demonstrated patient-level benefit subsequent to primary care IPV interventions, with IPV/community referrals the most common positively affected outcome.

Most research has focused on the intergenerational transmission of violence and identifying the intrapersonal mechanisms that enable violence in the family of origin to carry over to adult intimate relationships. This study expands the current literature by examining insecure attachment styles and destructive disagreement beliefs as mediators in the relationship between exposure to hostility or aggression in the family of origin and later experiences of dating aggression. Research questions were addressed with a sample of 1,136 college undergraduates (59% women). In all models, results of structural equation modeling indicated that an insecure attachment style and destructive disagreement beliefs mediated the intergenerational transmission of violence among both men and women. These findings have important implications for future research as well as relationship education programs and preventative interventions.

    abstract={Over the last several decades, an extensive literature has documented the prevalence of dating violence on college campuses. As a result, initiatives to promote awareness of dating violence on college campuses have proliferated and models of "bystander intervention" have been developed. Bystander intervention asserts that by giving all students information concerning the prevalence and warning signs of dating violence, these individuals will "say something" when they see problem behavior. However, a paucity of empirical research exists concerning whether students actually report their observation of dating violence among their peers. In the present study, a sample of college freshman ( n = 275) was surveyed regarding their willingness to report dating violence behaviors among their friends. Findings indicate that a slight majority of respondents report that they would report dating violence victimization among their friends to university officials (54%) and/or law enforcement (56%) while fewer indicated they would report perpetration, 38% and 42%, respectively. Importantly, respondents overwhelmingly report that they would attempt to intervene in the dating violence victimization (87%) and perpetration (84%). Implications of these findings for campus safety initiatives and bystander education models are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

Using community-based participatory approaches, we conducted a brief survey of professionals (e.g., shelter staff, domestic violence prevention and intervention programs, law enforcement) affiliated with one or more domestic violence prevention and/or intervention networks in Los Angeles, California. The sample, which included professionals ( N = 54) from diverse programs/agencies, was obtained using purposive and snowball sampling. Participants self-administered a 33-item, online questionnaire. Analyses primarily involved descriptive statistics (frequencies, proportions). Most respondents had little or no training in LGBT IPV; nevertheless, nearly 50% of them reported having assisted LGBTs "sometimes" or "often" in the past year. Nearly all (92%) reported that their agencies/programs lack staff with dedicated responsibilities to LGBT IPV. The most frequent requests for assistance respondents reported receiving from LGBTs were for counseling, safe housing, legal assistance, and assistance navigating the medical system. The findings suggest that staff believe their agencies/programs inadequately address LGBT IPV but that many of the inadequacies (e.g., lack of staff training on LGBT IPV) are remediable.

Drawing on open-ended responses by adolescent participants, the present study aimed to shed light on African American youths' perceptions of IPV, their perceptions regarding such violence among their peers, the dynamics of help-seeking behaviors, and what services youth perceive as most helpful in the prevention and intervention of adolescent IPV. Findings reveal that most participants only recognize physical aggression as IPV; express hesitation in disclosing violence to adults, especially nonfamily adults; and report being unaware of and/or unwilling to utilize existing prevention and intervention services traditionally targeted at adult populations.

Doctors and nurses reported increased self-efficacy, understanding of referral resources, and understanding of legal issues; IPV knowledge was unchanged. Intervention clinics implemented new policies and procedures, increased patient education, and increased documentation of IPV screening, an improvement which was sustained at 2-year follow-up. Results suggest HCCW is a promising practice for improving the healthcare response to IPV. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    abstract={This study assesses different types of work-related intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration and their relationship to perpetrators' work performance and employment. We determine if groups of abusive men with similar patterns of work-related IPV exist and then examine whether the patterns are related to their characteristics, job performance, and employment outcomes. Participants were 198 adult men (60% Latino, 40% non-Latino) from batterer intervention programs (BIPs) who self-reported their lifetime work-related IPV and job outcomes. Five distinct clusters were identified and named based on the pattern (predominance or absence) of different work-related abusive behaviors reported: (a) low-level tactics, (b) job interference, (c) job interference with threatened or actual violence, (d) extreme abuse without jealousy and (e) extreme abuse. Analyses revealed significant differences between the clusters on ethnicity, parental status, partner's employment status, income, education, and (among Latinos only) acculturation. The probability of men's work-related IPV substantially impacting their own job performance was nearly 4 times greater among those in the extreme abuse cluster than those in the low-level tactics cluster. These data inform the development of employee training programs and workplace policies for reducing IPV that affects the workplace.

    abstract={In order to offer optimal supports and services for mothers affected by intimate partner violence (IPV), an understanding of these mothers' perceptions of support needs, resources, barriers to support, and preferences for support intervention is warranted. Moreover, the growing recognition of the effects of IPV on maternalâ€“infant relationships and of the importance of these early relationships to long-term child health outcomes suggests interventions are needed to support optimal maternalâ€“infant relationships in these families. Thus, 64 mothers exposed to IPV when their infants were below 12 months of age participated in a retrospective qualitative study to identify mothers' support needs, resources, barriers to support, and preferences for specific support interventions to promote optimal motherâ€“infant relationships. Participants identified both personal needs (including needs for leaving or staying with the violent partner), along with intertwined needs to care for, and help, their infants cope with the experience of violence. Mothers reported that integrated services that include information and practical support from professionals with emotional and affirmation support from peers would promote positive, nurturing motherâ€“infant relationships and healthy child development.

    abstract={In this review, we provide a descriptive and detailed review of intervention programs for intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrators and survivor- victims. Given the extensive personal, interpersonal, and societal costs associated with IPV, i t is essential that services being offered by the criminal justice, mental health, and medical communities have requisite empirical support to justify their implementation. The review involved a detailed summary of all studies published since 1990 using randomized or quasi-experimental designs that compared an active intervention program to a relevant comparison condition. These studies included 20 studies investigating the effectiveness of "traditional" forms of batterer intervention programs (BIPs) aimed at perpetrators of IPV, 10 studies that investigated the effectiveness of alternative formats of BIPs, 16 studies of brief intervention programs for IPV victim-survivors, and 15 studies of more extended intervention programs for IPV victim-survivors. Interventions for perpetrators showed equivocal results regarding their ability to lower the risk of IPV, and available studies had many methodological flaws. More recent investigations of novel programs with alternative content have shown promising results. Among interventions for victim-survivors of IPV, a range of therapeutic approaches have been shown to produce enhancements in emotional functioning, with the strongest support for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches in reducing negative symptomatic effects of IPV. Supportive advocacy in community settings has been shown to reduce the frequency of revictimization relative to no-treatment controls, although rates of revictimization remain alarmingly high in these studies. Brief interventions for victim-survivors have had more complex and less consistently positive effects. Several studies have found significant increases in safety behaviors, but enhanced use of community resources is often not found. It remains unclear whether brief safety interventions produce longer term reduction in IPV revictimization. Discussion summarizes the general state of knowledge on interventions for IPV perpetrators and victim-survivors and important areas for future research.

Boys and those more involved with violence reported more violence-supportive attitudes.

For Dar es Salaam attitudes predicted behavior prospectively; however, prediction in the opposite direction was not confirmed.

For those who were initially reluctant to change, MI produced greater forward movement in stage of change. For those who claimed to have already solved their problems with partner abuse, MI produced greater backward movement in stage of change and greater homework compliance in subsequent group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). MI led to a stronger collaborative working alliance for those high in contemplation of change, and greater group session attendance for those with high trait anger. Contrary to hypotheses, analyses of post-CBT partner assault revealed a differentially greater benefit of MI for participants with lower levels of pretreatment contemplation and trait anger.

    abstract={The substantial increase in the enrollment of women in batterer intervention programs (BIPs) over the past 30 years has greatly outpaced research on women who perpetrate intimate partner violence (IPV). As a result, it is unknown whether existing programs, which were originally designed to treat male perpetrators, are effective at preventing recidivism among women. Recent research shows that men who perpetrate IPV may also aggress against nonintimate partners, children, and animals, and that the reach of their aggressive tendencies has implications for treatment. Conducting similar investigations on women who perpetrate IPV may help to inform treatment delivery in BIPs. This study examined the prevalence of adulthood animal abuse perpetration and its association with psychological and physical IPV perpetration in a sample of women arrested for domestic violence ( N = 87). Seventeen percent ( n = 15) of the women committed at least one act of animal abuse since the age of 18, in contrast to the 0.28% prevalence rate reported in the general population. The overrepresentation of animal abuse in this sample was consistent with that of men arrested for domestic violence. Furthermore, women who reported committing animal abuse as an adult showed moderately higher rates of psychological aggression and physical assault perpetration against their partners, relative to women who did not report animal abuse. Implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    abstract={Understanding why and how perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV) change their behavior is an important goal for both policy development and clinical practice. In this study, the authors investigated the concept of ''turning points'' for perpetrators of IPV by conducting a systematic review of qualitative studies that investigated the factors, situations, and attitudes that facilitated perpetrators' decisions to change their abusive behavior. Two literature databases were searched and six studies were found that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Most included participants from batterer intervention programs (BIPs). The data indicate that community, group, and individual processes all contribute to perpetrators' turning points and behavioral change. These include identifying key incidents that precede change, taking responsibility for past behavior, learning new skills, and developing relationships within and outside of the BIP. By using a qualitative systematic review, the authors were able to generate a more complete understanding of the catalysts for and process of change in these individuals. Further research, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches, will be helpful in the modification of existing BIPs and the development of new interventions to reduce IPV.

    abstract={Objective: Relatively little data exists on fear among men in violent relationships or on differences in the correlates of fear across distinct samples. This article describes two studies examining gender differences in self-reported fear of one's violent partner for two samples, college undergraduates and men and women referred to batterers' intervention. Method: Participants (N = 115 in Study 1; N = 108 in Study 2) completed an online survey assessing fear of a violent partner and hypothesized correlates of fear, including partner's violence and control, psychological and sexual aggression, and violence initiation. Results: Women reported significantly more fear of a violent partner than men. College men were the least fearful and intervention-sample women were most fearful. In the regression models, undergraduates' fear related to injuriousness of partner's violence. Fear for intervention-sample participants related primarily to violence initiation, especially for women. Intervention-sample participants scored substantially higher than students on nearly every assessed variable. Conclusions: Sample differences in self-reported fear, correlates of fear, and experiences of aggression likely reflect different types of violent relationships. Fear was common among intervention-sample women, suggesting the importance of assessing for victimization among samples identified as offenders, particularly for women. A single, brief question about fear of one's partner may assist in such screening. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

This article reviews and analyzes 16 campaigns targeting IPV perpetrators, created in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Two well-known models, the Transtheoretical (Stages of Change) model and Protection Motivation theory (PMT), are combined to create the analytical framework. For each stage of change, the most salient PMT variables are outlined, the people found in that stage are described, and the most effective strategies for persuasion are posited. Together, these two models would suggest that future campaigns targeting IPV perpetrators should place a stronger emphasis on the benefits of changing and place a greater focus on increasing perpetrators' confidence that they can abstain from violence.

    abstract={Women above the age of 60 who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) have specific needs compared with younger victims. More research is emerging that assists counselors and other helping professionals with identification of these needs and aids to promote the mental health and well-being of this population. Professionals must consider the generational values held by older IPV victims and understand how values may impact decision making. Integrating safety planning and risk assessment into the counseling process is vital. Older IPV victims may seek counseling for posttraumatic stress or depressive symptoms as a result of the abuse. Others may participate in counseling for issues unrelated to IPV. Therefore, a thorough assessment process should include questions related to relationship dynamics so that the counselor has a complete understanding of all factors impacting the client's functioning. Helping professionals must also have an understanding of available community resources, as well as barriers that these clients face as they take steps toward recovery from trauma. This research uses qualitative analysis of case studies to assist helping professionals in understanding the most effective interventions when working with this population. We found that a contextual approach focusing on the restoration of self-confidence is a constructive means of initiating recovery from trauma.

    abstract={Through an examination of the major trends in the last forty years in understanding the phenomenon of partner violence (PV), we can ascertain the movement from a dichotomous analysis of gender division, wherein men are perceived as perpetrators and women as victims, towards a more interactive and mutual dynamic. While intervention lags behind empirical knowledge, this trend enhances the controversy as to whether the unit of intervention in PV should be the male or the female, the individual or the couple. The first section of this paper provides a brief review of the development of our understanding of PV and the limited incorporation of new knowledge into core intervention goals with female and male clients. The second part of the paper illustrates how gender related controversies are reflected in the roles, self perceptions and functioning of therapists in the field. This section is based on qualitative data from a series of studies performed on therapists by the authors and their students during the last ten years. The transformative gender experience is examined, showing how the successful and open self-examination of gender related issues might lead to personal and professional growth.

Both fixed and modifiable risk factors that predicted change in children's adjustment after the intervention were identified and tested. There was a significant relationship between the extent of exposure to IPV, gender, change in mothers' mental health, and change in child adjustment. Among fixed factors, length of exposure to violence was found to moderate the relationship between the amount of the child's and mother's participation in the intervention and change in child adjustment, specifically internalizing behavioral problems. Among the modifiable risk factors, change in mother's mental health, specifically symptoms of posttraumatic stress, was found to mediate the relationship between the amount of intervention participation and change in child adjustment. These findings can be used to inform and enhance evidence-based clinical services for children exposed to IPV.

    abstract={Intimate partner violence (IPV), also known as domestic abuse or relationship violence, has generated a large research literature for the last half-century, particularly in the areas of criminal justice, psychology, and the social sciences. Interventions for victims and perpetrators of IPV have largely been sequestered to separately evolving efforts of law enforcement and the psychotherapeutic community (Chang et al. Women's Health Issues, 15(1), 21â€“30, 2005; Dalton Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment & Trauma, 15 (1), 59â€“75, 2007; Dobash and Dobash 2000; Feder et al. 2008; Gerbert et al. Journal of Family Practice, 49(10), 889â€“895, 2000; Wathen and MacMillan. Journal of the American Medical Association, 289(5), 589â€“600, 2003). This article presents a brief overview of the historical evolution and development of these discrete perspectives and identifies and assesses current collaborative interventions rooted in these historical precedents. In conclusion, the authors provide a summative discussion of the most current findings of research into IPV interventions, with a particular focus on the changing roles of race and gender in both the criminal prosecution of IPV and services provided to IPV perpetrators and victims.

The authors review existing economic evaluations and present case studies of current research from the United Kingdom and Australia to illustrate the strengths and limitations of two approaches to generating economic evidence: economic evaluation alongside randomized controlled trials and economic modeling. Economic evaluation should always be considered in the design of IPV intervention research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    abstract={Given the mounting support for the connection between IPV exposure and negative sequelae for children, the development and empirical testing of interventions for IPV-exposed children has been deemed a critical priority. However, it is difficult for researchers to build a body of research concerned with interventions for IPV-exposed children without a critical summary and analysis of existing research. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive literature review and a critical analysis of the literature concerned with interventions that either directly or indirectly target IPV-exposed children. Our search identified 31 articles for review, and detailed summaries of all articles are provided, including the program focus, study design, sample information, and key study findings, as well as study strengths and limitations. Our analysis determined four categories of interventions in this literature review: counseling/therapy, crisis/outreach, parenting, and multicomponent intervention programs. Our findings also show that researchers have mainly tried to address needs of IPV-exposed children by offering services to children directly, and/or to caregivers who are mothers. We discuss summaries of the intervention program's foci and service strategies. In addition, we offer recommendations for future intervention research.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2008-04235-003). This study investigated the relationship between the specific factors of the Masculine Gender Role Stress (MGRS) scale and intimate partner violence among a clinical sample of violent men. Participants were 339 men court-mandated to attend violence intervention programs. After demonstrating that the 5-factor MGRS model evidenced strong fit in this sample, analyses revealed that MGRS total scores were associated with each form of intimate partner violence perpetration. However, subsequent analyses that regressed each form of aggression onto all 5 MGRS factors simultaneously revealed that different factors were responsible for each association. Specifically, gender role stress regarding failure to perform in work and sexual domains was the only factor associated with psychological aggression, gender role stress regarding appearing physically fit and not appearing feminine was the only factor associated with sexual coercion, and gender role stress regarding intellectual inferiority was the only factor associated with injury to partners. No single MGRS factor was uniquely associated with physical aggression. Implications are discussed in terms of the importance of examining specific domains of gender role stress when studying and treating partner violence.

Seventy-three men solicited from a community program for male batterers completed a questionnaire regarding help-seeking behaviors. Of these participants, 12 participated in subsequent focus group discussions. Approximately two-thirds of the participants identified they had sought help regarding the problems in their intimate relationships; however, only half of them actually received help that addressed their violent behaviors. Furthermore, of those participants who received help, only one-quarter found the help to be useful or effective. When reviewing both the questionnaire responses and focus group transcripts, several help-seeking themes emerged from the data including numerous missed opportunities to intervene, men's view of masculinity and help-seeking, and the critical role of developing trust, non-judgmental and confidential counseling relationships. The results have implications for both public education campaigns and training of professionals to address domestic violence issues in male clients.

The possibility of further advances has been limited, however, because of the gender paradigm, the collective set of prevailing beliefs about family violence that have guided policy and intervention over the past twenty five years. In this article, evidence is presented against such paradigmic assumptions that partner violence is perpetrated exclusively or mostly by men, has adverse consequences exclusively or mostly to women, and that intervention ought to be limited to same-sex psychoeducational groups based on feminist ideology.

    abstract={The efficacy of psychosocial interventions for perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV) has been increasingly challenged in recent years, largely in response to reviews of research showing limited program effects. This article addresses the state of the art in research on IPV perpetrator interventions. After considering previous quantitative reviews of research in this area, new trends and innovations are addressed, including culturally focused interventions, case management and comprehensive services, supportive efforts to enhance program attendance, and interventions focused on motivation to change. Recent research has failed to provide clear evidence that race-specific groups or culturally focused content enhances the efficacy of standard IPV interventions. Similarly, research exploring case management for IPV perpetrators revealed important problems in implementation of the intervention and no clear evidence of improved outcomes. However, some evidence indicates that the integration of substance use interventions may enhance violence reduction. Supportive interventions designed to enhance program attendance and motivation to change have yielded consistently encouraging results, including significant effects on program attendance, compliance with IPV intervention tasks, and increased personal change and help-seeking efforts. These interventions have shown favorable initial effects in reducing abusive behavior relative to treatment-as-usual controls, and they are highlighted as a potentially fruitful avenue for continued research.

Two methods are attempted to increase assessment/documentation of IPV: a physician educational intervention and a nursing routine inquiry intervention in one quadrant of the practice. The IPV physician educational intervention includes didactic sessions, an IPV counselor, and resource information. The routine inquiry intervention involves nurses screening female patients for IPV at check-in. IPV is found to be prevalent in a general medicine clinic. An enhanced educational intervention does not increase IPV documentation. A routine inquiry intervention significantly increases documentation of lifetime IPV but does not impact current IPV identification.

    abstract={Studies suggest that experience and expectations of intimate partner violence (IPV) among college women may be positively related. We investigated their association using modified versions of two standard measures: the Conflict Tactics Scale and the Multidimensional Emotional Abuse Scale. Five hundred and thirty-four college women completed each measure twice: once based on their partner's actual behaviors and once based on what they expected a male partner would do in a relationship. Results demonstrated that IPV experience and IPV expectations are significantly and positively related. Results also showed that respondents expected more IPV than they reportedly experienced, suggesting that college women may believe that IPV occurs more frequently in others' relationships than in their own. Findings suggest that behavioral interventions for IPV victims should address IPV expectations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    pages={55-68},
    abstract={Routine screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) has been introduced in many health settings to improve identification and responsiveness to IPV. The debate about the level of evidence required to warrant routine screening continues. Three assumptions have impeded progress in measuring the impact of screening. The first is that routine screening is a test only which does not of itself have an impact on patients. The second is that it can be assessed by evaluating interventions provided to women after abuse is identified through screening. The third is that there can be an agreed appropriate intervention for IPV. Each of these assumptions is problematic. In addition, there are significant impediments to evaluating screening as an intervention through a randomized control trial. These include identification of the study group, isolating the control group from the intervention, ethics, lack of baseline data, and recall bias. A range of study designs is required and a rethink of assumptions is needed in researching this area. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

Participants were invited to complete the Chinese Abuse Assessment Screen and a demographic questionnaire. About 9% of the pregnant women reported having been abused by their partners in the preceding year. In-law conflict was the characteristic most significantly associated with preceding-year abuse against pregnant women, after controlling for covariates. Findings underscore the need to obtain information on in-law conflict as a risk factor for IPV. In-law conflict should be included in the assessment of risk for IPV. For the prevention of IPV, family-based intervention is needed to work with victims as well as in-laws. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    pages={1322-1333},
    abstract={Adolescent mothers are at high risk of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) which may increase their likelihood of depressive symptoms in adulthood, yet little is known about the long-term effects of IPV on adolescent mothers' trajectories of depressive symptoms. The study reported here uses prospective data spanning 14 years from a study of 229 adolescent mothers from Washington State, USA to evaluate the effects of adolescent exposure to IPV on the trajectories of depressive symptoms over time, as well as the likelihood of depressive symptoms at age 28 years. After controlling for levels of economic insecurity, the results indicate that adolescent IPV and an early vulnerability to depression were significantly related to the intercept, but not the slope of the adult depressive symptom trajectories. Both cumulative and concurrent IPV predicted the likelihood of depressive symptoms at age 28 years. Follow-up analyses indicate that adolescent IPV is associated with greater levels of adult IPV, and that women who report both adolescent and adult IPV have the highest mean levels of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that exposure to IPV in adolescence may alter the life course of young women, increasing their risk for continuing exposure to intimate partner violence in adulthood and its concomitant negative mental health effects. Efforts aimed at prevention and early intervention in IPV among adolescent mothers are important components of the clinical care of young mothers.

All participants were then referred to a cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) program in groups homogeneous with respect to intake condition. The motivational intake led to more constructive in-session behavior during the early phase of group CBT, greater compliance with group CBT homework assignments, higher late session therapist ratings of the working alliance, and more help seeking outside of the domestic violence program. No significant effects of intake condition were found on session attendance, self-reports of readiness to change abusive behavior, or client reports of the working alliance. Partner reports of abusive behavior outcomes during the 6 months after group CBT revealed a marginal effect favoring the MI condition on physical assault. The findings suggest that motivational interviewing can increase receptivity to partner violence interventions.

    abstract={Although research has yielded mixed findings regarding the effectiveness of intervention programs for partner-violent men, it appears that greater participant compliance with such programs is associated with better outcomes. However, no research to date has jointly examined compliance with intervention programs and the extent to which partner-violent men learn specific information presented during the programs. The current study makes use of existing data to evaluate general and specific elements of partner-violent men's compliance with (i.e., active, appropriate participation in) an intervention program and recall of key points from the program. Results from a subsample of 22 men indicate that at program termination, those rated as having been "process conscious" during intervention group sessions, having self-disclosed during sessions, having evidenced awareness and use of techniques to avoid violence, and having used respectful language show greater recall of material taught in the program. This finding points to the potential benefit of taking steps to increase men's active participation in programs and of studying active engagement as a mediator of program effects on men's violence toward partners.

    abstract={Objectives: We sought to determine the frequency of intimate partner violence by type in a large, clinic-based, nurse-administered screening and services intervention project. Methods: A brief intimate partner violence screen, which included items to measure sexual and physical assaults and psychological battering (using the Women's Experience With Battering scale) was administered to consenting women receiving care at 1 of 8 rural clinics in South Carolina. Results: Between April 2002 and August 2005, 4945 eligible women were offered intimate partner violence screening, to which 3664 (74.1%) consented. Prevalence of intimate partner violence in a current (ongoing) relationship was 13.3%, and 939 women (25.6%) had experienced intimate partner violence at some point in the past 5 years. Of those ever experiencing intimate partner violence, the majority (65.6%) experienced both assaults and psychological battering; 10.1% experienced assault only, and 24.3% experienced psychological battering only. Most women (85.5%) currently experiencing both psychological battering and assaults stated that violence was a problem in their current relationship. Conclusions: The intimate partner violence screening technique we used was feasible to implement, acceptable to women seeking health care at the targeted clinics, and indicated a high proportion of women reporting intimate partner violence in the past 5 years, with a majority of those women stating that such violence was a problem in their relationships. These findings demonstrated the viability of the screening technique, which supports the growing importance of implementing intimate partner violence screenings in clinical settings in order to reduce the prevalence of violence in intimate relationships.

    abstract={There are limited empirical data regarding the reasons or motives for the perpetration of intimate partner violence among women arrested for domestic violence and court referred to violence intervention programs. The present study examined arrested women's self-report reasons for partner violence perpetration and investigated whether women who were victims of severe intimate partner violence were more likely than were women who were victims of minor partner violence to report self-defense as a reason for their behavior. In all, 87 women in violence intervention programs completed a measure of violence perpetration and victimization and a questionnaire assessing 29 reasons for violence perpetration. Self-defense, poor emotion regulation, provocation by the partner, and retaliation for past abuse were the most common reasons for violence perpetration. Victims of severe partner violence were significantly more likely than were victims of minor partner violence to report self-defense as a reason for their violence perpetration. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    abstract={Though many studies have documented the high prevalence, morbidity, mortality and costs attributable to intimate partner violence (IPV), it is still unclear how our health care system should address this major public health problem. Many have advocated for routine screening, yet there is still insufficient evidence that routine IPV screening can lead to improved outcomes. Though recognition of IPV is very important, a screening paradigm may not be the optimal way to approach IPV within the health care system. For many patients, exposure to violence is a chronic condition, characterized by long-term abusive relationships, histories of childhood and community violence, multiple associated chronic symptoms, and extra barriers to addressing their other chronic illnesses. Thus, there may be important lessons to be learned from work being done in the area of chronic care. We explore how Wagner's Chronic Care model may guide efforts to improve health care for IPV survivors and may serve as a framework for future research studies.

    volume={20},
    number={2},
    pages={235-250},
    abstract={The Transtheoretical Model has been recently applied to men seeking services at battering intervention and prevention programs (Eckhardt, Babcock, & Homack, 2004; Murphy & Baxter, 1997). This study considers whether women arrested for intimate partner violence differ from male perpetrators in terms of stages of change and processes of change. No gender differences were found regarding stage of change. In general, all individuals presenting for treatment were in the early stages of change. The use of various processes of change was strongly related to stage of change, with individuals in the more advanced stages of change using more behavioral and experiential strategies to become nonviolent. However, except for the use of social liberation strategies, there were no gender differences in the use of the various processes. These findings suggest that the Transtheoretical Model may apply to female perpetrators equally as well as to male perpetrators. Intervention programs designed for male batterers using the Transtheoretical Model may also be helpful in the treatment of women arrested for domestic violence.

To date there is little evidence to show the value of these efforts, and many completed studies are criticized for methodological weaknesses. IPV studies are challenging to design, and the double-blind randomized controlled trial may be an impossible standard. To move forward, funders and study committees are encouraged to reassess the standards for IPV research methodologies.

This article addresses the prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual assault among Native Americans. We present significant substantive and methodological issues that inform research on violence in the lives of Native Americans, as well as existing interventions. Interventions discussed in this article fall within three major categories including those that are community based, those grounded in the public health and health care systems, and those grounded in federal and national organizations. We provide some examples of interventions from each of these three levels of direct service, including a brief discussion of barriers to service accessibility. We conclude with substantive and methodological recommendations for research and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

    pages={260-284},
    abstract={The efficacy of batterer treatment is a concern of clinicians, researchers, and policy makers. Most past research on batterer treatment has defined success as a cessation of men's physical abuse against their intimate partner. Although clearly an important outcome, focus on assault leaves many questions unanswered about the broader impact of batterer treatment and the processes through which successful change may be promoted. With the aim of encouraging complexity in the consideration of change among batterers, the current article reviews studies that go beyond dichotomous outcomes. First, evidence for the success of batterer treatment is considered from multiple perspectives: men's, women's, and the intervention system. Next, an in-depth review of research on factors relating to change in abusive men is completed using feminist, family systems, individual, and typology theories as an organizing framework. Numerous recommendations are made for integrating theories of change with investigations of treatment success in future work.

Findings confirm that TRO petitioners report many types of abuse and while half of TRO defendants do not re-offend, a small percent of defendants are responsible for multiple police reports, arrests, and criminal violations.

    abstract={As the baby boomer generation ages, there are more than 18 million women older than 65 (13.4% of the female population in the United States). More than 41% of these women remain in intimate relationships with their partner and thus become vulnerable to intimate partner violence (IPV). This group of women represents a unique group in the violence literature. Most of this literature has focused on IPV in women of childbearing age. What happens to these women and their relationships as they age? How does IPV differ for women who are not functionally dependent and not relying on their intimate partner for care?

    abstract={This study examined the expectations to help victims of intimate partner violence held by potential informal helpers such as friends and family. A total of 157 college students (male and female; aged 18-34 yrs old) viewed 1 of 2 videotaped domestic violence scenarios, which varied on victim "provocation." The present study tested a specific model in which victim blame mediates the relationship between helper characteristics and the type of intervention helpers expect to use. The model accounted for 22% of variance in general victim blame, 40% of variance in blame toward the victim's specific behavior/characteristics, and 27% of variance in the expectation to use specific helpful interventions. High perceived provocation and violence-condoning attitudes held by participants predicted greater victim blame, and general victim blame appeared to mediate the relationship between attitudes and intervention. Female participants demonstrated less general victim blame and provided more helpful interventions than males. Implications for educational programs and continued research are discussed.

The sample was fairly homogeneous demographically. Results revealed a high level of physical injury (89%) and a low level of reporting violent incidents to the police (26%). Although 75% sought medical care, women first turned for assistance to pastors and counselors. Multisectoral support to strengthen and expand the services of the Women's Crisis Centre is recommended.

    abstract={Prevalence of children's exposure to intimate partner violence has been estimated at 10% to 20% each year. Many children exposed to domestic violence appear to manifest negative effects. Limited research suggests the possibility of long-term effects such as lowered self-esteem and depression. Factors that moderate children's responses to domestic violence include the nature of the discord, the child's age and gender, exposure to other forms of maltreatment, and the presence of factors that buffer the child, such as social support. Mediating factors that may help explain why exposure to domestic violence is harmful to children include disrupted parenting, inadequate coping responses, and development of posttraumatic stress reactions. Group and individual intervention with children who witness partner abuse should be focused around enhancing safety. Additional goals include better understanding of domestic violence and perpetrator responsibility for abuse, improved coping and problem solving, and facilitation of expression of feelings.
