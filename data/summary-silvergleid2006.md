In general, research on the effectiveness of IPV perpetrator intervention programs in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including the above-reviewed research, provides a mixture of evidence in favor and not in favor of these programs' effectiveness [@feder2005meta]. The above-reviewed subset of the IPV-related literature reiterates the general ambiguity regarding effective approaches to IPV interventions. Nonetheless, it is important to understand the processes underlying successful outcomes (e.g., reduced or eliminated recidivism among participants) in these interventions. @silvergleid2006how provide one such exploration of the key processes facilitating positive change among men who successfully completed an IPV perpetrator intervention program in Portland, Oregon.

@silvergleid2006how conducted in-depth, semi-structured, one-on-one interviews with ten intervention group facilitators and nine men who were within two-weeks of having completed their participation in the intervention and who were nominated by group facilitators. Four levels of change processes were identified through inductive thematic analysis of the interview data: (1) "community and extratherapeutic influences", (2) "organizational influences", (3) "group processes", and (4) "individual psychological development" (p. 144). The group-level processes seem especially influential in terms of facilitating a _process_ of change, in that this level of influence is further categorized into three sub-processes that appear to build from one another: (1) balancing support and confrontation, (2) sharing and hearing stories, and (3) modeling and mentoring. Facilitators' accounts further emphasized the group-level influences as instrumental in the process underlying intervention participants' "'resocialization' into a new manhood" (p. 151).
