A comparative evaluation was also conducted by @hendricks2006recidivism with two IPV perpetrator intervention programs in a small metropolitan Wisconsin county [@ingram2012nchs]. Although @hendricks2006recidivism ultimately describes the programs evaluated their investigation as two independent interventions, one of the programs, _"Reasoning & Rehabilitation (R&R)"_ is in fact evaluated as a `sort of nested or secondary` intervention within the county's larger IPV perpetrator intervention system, _"Stopping Abuse for Everyone (SAFE)"_ (p. 704). That is, individuals are referred to the _R&R_ program `if they are determined as in need of` greater levels of supervision based on a clinical assessment administered during the _SAFE_ program's intake process. Such individuals are expected to return to and complete the _SAFE_ program's intervention after completing the additional _R&R_ program. @hendricks2006recidivism\'s investigation also included an evaluation of the predictive validity of the _Level of Service Inventoryâ€“Revised_ [_LSI-R_; @andrews1994level], which is the assessment administed to determine intervention participants' levels of risk and need at intake for the _SAFE_ program. Regarding the latter, results from logistic regression analyses provided minimal support for the LSI-R scale's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in correctly classifying recidivating intervention participants (overall classification accuracy = 66% correct). However, while formal logistic regression analysis was not similarly conducted to examine the measure's predictive accuracy regarding program placement, comparisons<!-- via between-subjects factorial--> via cross-tabulations and chi-square ($\chisq$) analyses revealed significant differences in both LSI-R scores and recidivism rates among intervention participants. Specifically, participants who completed the _SAFE_ program without referral to the _R&R_ program (14.4% recidivated) had signficantly lower recidivism rates than those who completed both interventions (32.4% recidivated; $\chisq(1) = 6.26,~p < .05$). As @hendricks2006recidivism note, because participants were referred to the _R&R_ program on the basis of their LSI-R scores, these differences in recidivism rates do not necessarily inform comparisons regarding each interention program's individual effectiveness at reducing or preventing future violence pereptration among participants. However, a possibly missing point in @hendricks2006recidivism\'s report and analytic conclusions is that these observed differences may provide support for the discriminant validity of the LSI-R as a measure effective in determining the relative risk and needs levels of IPV pereptration intervention participants.
