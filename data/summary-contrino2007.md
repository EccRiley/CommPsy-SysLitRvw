@contrino2007compliance quantitatively examined intervention program participants' levels of compliance with program requirements (e.g., attendance, engagement with the program, maintaining sobriety, nonviolence, etc.) and the extent to which participants retain key components of the intervention's content (e.g., power and control dynamics versus non-controlling behaviors). This investigation's focus aligns with @silvergleid2006how\'s qualitative findings regarding key influences underlying and facilitating IPV perpetrator intervention program participants' change processes. Specifically,<!--both program participant and facilitator --> interviewees in @silvergleid2006how\'s sample emphasized the importance of learning new skills (e.g., taking a 'time-out') and engagement with program activities (e.g., reading required texts, journaling, acknowledging their past violent behaviors and the impact of those behaviors on others, etc.) in the change processes experienced by program participants:

> "The most emphasized aspect of awareness was the participantâ€™s new understanding of the effects of their abuse on others. For many men, truly sit- ting with that understanding, the devastating impact of their actions on those around them, was a strong impetus for change" (@silvergleid2006how, p. 153).

Findings from @contrino2007compliance\'s process evaluation somewhat reiterate @silvergleid2006how\'s findings in that participants' recall of intervention content related to power and control dynamics  levels of compliance with certain domains of program expectations, including (1) using techniques to avoid violence, (2) process-consciousness and communication skills, (3) self-disclosure of ones's feelings and non-defensiveness, and (4) use of respectful language. Other assessed program expectations including participants' program attendance, active engagement in group sessions, sobriety, nonviolence, and help-seeking were not associated with the number of forms of power and control they were able to recall [see @gondolf2009clinician].
