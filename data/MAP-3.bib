    title={Receiving care for intimate partner violence in primary care: Barriers and enablers for women participating in the weave randomised controlled trial},
    journal={Social science & medicine},
    volume={160},
    pages={35-42},
    abstract={Background: Interventions in health settings for intimate partner violence (IPV) are being increasingly recognised as part of a response to addressing this global public health problem. However, interventions targeting this sensitive social phenomenon are complex and highly susceptible to context. This study aimed to elucidate factors involved in women's uptake of a counselling intervention delivered by family doctors in the weave primary care trial (Victoria, Australia). Methods: We analysed associations between women's and doctors' baseline characteristics and uptake of the intervention. We interviewed a random selection of 20 women from an intervention group women to explore cognitions relating to intervention uptake. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded in NVivo 10 and analysed using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Results: Abuse severity and socio-demographic characteristics (apart from current relationship status) were unrelated to uptake of counselling (67/137 attended sessions). Favourable doctor communication was strongly associated with attendance. Eight themes emerged, including four sets of beliefs that influenced attitudes to uptake: (i) awareness of the abuse and readiness for help; (ii) weave as an avenue to help; (iii) doctor's communication; and (iv) role in providing care for IPV; and four sets of beliefs regarding women's control over uptake: (v) emotional health, (vi) doctors' time, (vii) managing the disclosure process and (viii) viewing primary care as a safe option. Conclusions: This study has identified factors that can promote the implementation and evaluation of primary care-based IPV interventions, which are relevant across health research settings, for example, ensuring fit between implementation strategies and characteristics of the target group (such as range in readiness for intervention). On practice implications, providers' communication remains a key issue for engaging women. A key message arising from this work concerns the critical role of primary care and health services more broadly in reaching victims of domestic violence, and providing immediate and ongoing support (depending on the healthcare context).

    abstract={A meta-analysis on domestic violence interventions was conducted to determine overall effectiveness of mental health programs involving women and children in joint treatment. These interventions were further analyzed to determine whether outcomes are differentially affected based on the outcome measure employed. To date, no meta-analyses have been published on domestic violence victim intervention efficacy. The 17 investigations that met study criteria yielded findings indicating that domestic violence interventions have a large effect size ( d = .812), which decreases to a medium effect size when compared to control groups ( d = .518). Effect sizes were assessed to determine whether treatment differed according to the focus of the outcome measure employed: (a) external stress (behavioral problems, aggression, or alcohol use); (b) psychological adjustment (depression, anxiety, or happiness); (c) self-concept (self-esteem, perceived competence, or internal locus of control); (d) social adjustment (popularity, loneliness, or cooperativeness); (e) family relations (motherâ€“child relations, affection, or quality of interaction); and (f) maltreatment events (reoccurrence of violence, return to partner). Results reveal that domestic violence interventions across all outcome categories yield effects in the medium to large range for both internalized and externalized symptomatology. Implications for greater awareness and support for domestic violence treatment and programming are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

Meanwhile, correctional programs used to treat a variety of offenders (e.g., substance users, violent offenders, and so forth) that adhere to the "principles of effective intervention" (PEI) have reported significant reductions in recidivism. This article introduces the PEIâ€”the principles on which evidence-based practices in correctional rehabilitation are basedâ€”and identifies the degree to which they are currently integrated into BIPs. The case is made that batterer programs could be more effective if they incorporate the PEI. Recommendations for further integration of the principles into BIPs are also provided.

    abstract={To provide a more robust assessment of the effectiveness of a domestic abuse prevention education program, a questionnaire was developed to measure children's attitudes to domestic violence. The aim was to develop a short questionnaire that would be easy to use for practitioners but, at the same time, sensitive enough to pick up on subtle changes in young people's attitudes. We therefore chose to ask children about different situations in which they might be willing to condone domestic violence. In Study 1, we tested a set of 20 items, which we reduced by half to a set of 10 items. The factor structure of the scale was explored and its internal consistency was calculated. In Study 2, we tested the factor structure of the 10-item Attitudes to Domestic Violence (ADV) Scale in a separate calibration sample. Finally, in Study 3, we then assessed the testâ€“retest reliability of the 10-item scale. The ADV Questionnaire is a promising tool to evaluate the effectiveness of domestic abuse education prevention programs. However, further development work is necessary.

Overall, men who completed DV classes were less likely to reoffend than those who did not. Men in the Spanish-language group had better outcomes than men in the English-language group. In addition, substance use, timing of probation violations, employment, court rereferrals to DV classes, and previous DV convictions all had an impact on rate of class completion and/or reoffense.

Mothers assigned to the treatment group participated in a 10-session evidence-based intervention, known as the Moms' Empowerment Program, which targets the mental health problems of women and works to increase access to resources and improve parenting abilities of women exposed to IPV. Participants were interviewed at baseline and immediately following the intervention or waitlist period, representing an elapsed time of approximately 5 weeks. After controlling for relevant demographic variables, violence severity, and mental health, women showed significantly more change in their positive parenting scores if they were in the treatment condition. No significant differences were found between the treatment and comparison groups in their negative parenting practices change scores. These findings suggest that even short-term intervention can improve positive parenting skills and parenting knowledge for women who have experienced partner abuse.

    pages={218-230},
    abstract={Changes in social policy are often pursued with the goal of reducing a social problem by improving prevention efforts, intervention program practices, or participant outcomes. State legislative standards for intimate partner violence intervention programs have been adopted nearly universally across the US, however, we do not know whether such standards actually achieve the intended goal of affecting programs' policies and practices. To assess the effect that batterer intervention program (BIP) standards have on policies and practices of programs, this study used longitudinal surveys collected as part of an ongoing evaluation conducted from 2001 to the present to compare intervention program ( N = 74) characteristics and practices at three time points before and after the adoption of standards in Oregon. Analyses were conducted to examine all BIPs in Oregon at each time point, as well as change among a subset of programs in existence at all survey assessments. Results indicate that across all programs, the use of mixed gender group co-facilitation increased by 14 % between 2004 and 2008, while program length increased by approximately 12 weeks. However, other practices such as programs' coordination with community partners were unchanged. Analyses of within-program change revealed fewer differences, with only program length increasing significantly over the three assessments. These and other findings indicate that while standards affected program length as intended, other practices commonly addressed by legislative standards remained unchanged. The findings provide needed information regarding programs' compliance with components of the standards, the potential need for compliance monitoring, and the potential impact of state standards on program effectiveness and on the prevalence of intimate partner violence.

Nine challenges were identified including difficulty finding qualified facilitators, inadequate funding, difficulty meeting training requirements, high workloads, trouble creating and maintaining collaborations, inability to accommodate diverse participant needs, conflict between state standards and county requirements, and perceived gaps between standards and evidence-based practices. These findings inform controversy surrounding BIP standards and efforts to increase BIP effectiveness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

The current study examined whether Journey to Change, a transtheoretical model of behavior change-based treatment adjunct that consists of 3 computer-administered sessions and a print guide, could improve outcomes. Method: Male domestic violence offenders (N = 492) attending court-mandated batterer treatment were assigned to usual care (UC) or usual care + Journey to Change (UC + Journey). Results: Compared with UC, participants receiving UC + Journey were significantly more likely to be in the action stage at the end of treatment and to seek help and services outside of group. Based on victim reports, the UC + Journey group was significantly less likely than the UC group to engage in physical violence during the 12-month follow-up. Both groups were equally likely to drop out of court-mandated treatment and to have further domestic violence-related police involvement. However, among participants with police involvement, the UC + Journey group had lower rates of documented violence and physical injury. Conclusion: The pattern of findings across the multiple outcomes suggests that the Journey to Change program holds promise for improving some outcomes for domestic violence offenders in treatment and warrants further investigation.

Using an experimental design with random assignment to groups, program impact on participating parents' knowledge, behavior, and attitudes compared to those of a comparison group of parents receiving standard community-based support services was examined. As hypothesized, the ACT Parents Raising Safe Kids program achieved positive results in several areas related to effective parenting, including a reduction in the use of harsh verbal and physical discipline and an increase in nurturing behavior. Positive results were observable both at the conclusion of the ACT program and at three-month follow-up. Results further indicated a positive impact on parent expectations and social support for those parents with the greatest need in these areas. Qualitative data collected through focus groups demonstrated that parents themselves perceived numerous benefits to the ACT program, including assistance in controlling their anger, learning and implementing better parenting and discipline strategies, and recognizing when their child's behavior is developmentally appropriate. Overall, findings suggest that the ACT Parents Raising Safe Kids program is a promising primary prevention strategy that can be implemented across diverse community settings.

Results indicated that intervention delivery was feasible in the novel setting of a large urban day care center. This intervention has promise as a strategy to reduce HIV among low-income women; however, a controlled study is indicated to further examine intervention efficacy.

Culturally-specific topics emphasized by participants and integrated into the program are: effective parenting skills for men; gender roles; discussion of discrimination towards immigrants and women; immigration and changing gender roles; marital sexual abuse; and spirituality as related to violence prevention. Attention is given to alcohol abuse and childhood trauma. Results suggest the desirability of an empathic and culturally-sensitive approach, without diminishing responsibility.

    abstract={Over the past 25 years, batterer intervention has become the most probable disposition following a plea or conviction on domestic battery charges and, consequently, batterer intervention programs (BIPs) have proliferated.

The aim of this study was to examine the philosophy, structure, leadership, curricula, and support systems of BIPs. Respondents from 276 batterer intervention programs in 45 states described their programs via an anonymous, Web-based survey. The results provide some insight regarding the workings of actual BIPs and also point out problems such as the dearth of programs in languages other than English and the failure to translate recommendations for prescriptive approaches into practice.

    abstract={Routine screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) has been introduced in many health settings to improve identification and responsiveness to IPV. The debate about the level of evidence required to warrant routine screening continues. Three assumptions have impeded progress in measuring the impact of screening. The first is that routine screening is a test only which does not of itself have an impact on patients. The second is that it can be assessed by evaluating interventions provided to women after abuse is identified through screening. The third is that there can be an agreed appropriate intervention for IPV. Each of these assumptions is problematic. In addition, there are significant impediments to evaluating screening as an intervention through a randomized control trial. These include identification of the study group, isolating the control group from the intervention, ethics, lack of baseline data, and recall bias. A range of study designs is required and a rethink of assumptions is needed in researching this area. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

However, no research to date has jointly examined compliance with intervention programs and the extent to which partner-violent men learn specific information presented during the programs. The current study makes use of existing data to evaluate general and specific elements of partner-violent men's compliance with (i.e., active, appropriate participation in) an intervention program and recall of key points from the program. Results from a subsample of 22 men indicate that at program termination, those rated as having been "process conscious" during intervention group sessions, having self-disclosed during sessions, having evidenced awareness and use of techniques to avoid violence, and having used respectful language show greater recall of material taught in the program. This finding points to the potential benefit of taking steps to increase men's active participation in programs and of studying active engagement as a mediator of program effects on men's violence toward partners.

The accounts described a range of individual-level processes of change consistent with prior research but also included several processes spanning the community, organizational, and group levels of analysis. Program completers and facilitators gave mostly similar accounts, though differed in their emphasis of criminal justice system sanctions, group resocialization of masculinity, and the participants' own decision to change. All accounts especially emphasized group-level processes and the importance of balancing support and confrontation from facilitators and group members. The findings demonstrate the importance of obtaining multiple perspectives on change processes, and support ecological and systems models of batterer intervention.

This investigation sought to explore the discursive forms which underlie the intervention program. 11 Ss (aged 18â€“60 yrs) participated in the study. Data gathering involved one of the authors participating in 9 3-hour sessions and observing the social context and conduct of the group. Four discourses were identified as underlying the program. Dominating the program was the Liberal Humanist discourse which emphasizes personal freedom and responsibility. The Romantic discourse of violence as expressive of inner tension was also evident in the talk and practices of the program. Other practices were informed by the Structuralist social systems discourse and the social systemic discourse. The authors note that while the participant observation research strategy is commonly employed as a 'process evaluation' method, its role within a distinctly post-structuralist program is a novel application of a well-established research strategy. It is argued that this has significant implications for how social scientists may approach participant observation and evaluation in the future.

This article documents emergency department staff responses to a five-step protocol of care on partner abuse implemented in a public hospital. It draws on in-depth interviews with a range of emergency department staff members, undertaken as part of the project's process evaluation. Findings suggest protocol training provided staff members with an opportunity to gain a greater awareness and understanding of partner abuse. Protocol use improved and consolidated existing practices; however, staff members were concerned about screening all women for abuse and highlighted areas in which further support and resources are required. Taking these factors into account may assist the appropriate and effective introduction of such protocols in other health care settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

    abstract={Acomparative multisite evaluation was conducted in four geographically distributed cities to examine the relative effectiveness of different approaches to batterer intervention. The intervention systems represent a range of court-referral procedures (pretrial or postconviction), program duration (3 mo to 9 mo), and additional services (occasional referral or in-house alcohol treatment). At each site, 210 men (mean age 32 yrs) were recruited and assessed using the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory and Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. The batterers' partners were interviewed by phone every 3 mo over a 15-mo follow-up after intake, with a response rate of 77% overall. There was no significant difference in the reassault rate, portion of men making threats, and victim quality of life across the four sites. The longest, most comprehensive program did, however have a significantly lower rate of severe reassault substantiated in a logistic regression controlling background variables. The findings suggest that differing intervention systems that conform to fundamental standards can achieve similar outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The current research employed a multitude of techniques to follow 139 battered women over the 1st yr following their stay at a shelter for women with abusive partners. The tracking rate was very successful; 96% were found and interviewed at the 10-wk project termination point, 96% at the 6-mo follow-up, and 94% at the 12-mo follow-up. The intricate system of procedures used for successfully tracking this mobile population over time are presented as an effective methodology for doing necessary longitudinal research with battered women as well as other transient or difficult to follow populations.

    pages={181-197},
    abstract={Our article reports data from a three-year formative study of the Illinois Protocol for Domestic Abuse Batterers Programs. This evaluation research is guided by 3 questions: (1) How do standards affect the way batterer programs deliver services to men who batter? (2) How do standards impact community efforts to prevent violence? and (3) How do standards affect judicial referral for domestic violence intervention? Data include: (1) surveys of 50 victim service agencies, 63 batterer programs, and 823 men in 27 batterer programs, and (2) structured interviews with 146 key informants, including judges and prosecutors, battered women's advocates, and batterer program staff. Results suggest that standards meet the goals set for them, although with some unintended consequences. The primary effects of the Illinois standards are providing a structure for programs working with men who batter, structuring collaboration between batterer programs and victim service agencies, increasing judicial confidence that batterers are being served appropriately, and forcing victim programs to think about batterer programs.

    abstract={The development of batterer treatment program standards was a well-intentioned and reasonable step, given the increasing number of batterers being court-referred to treatment, the poor quality of some treatment programs, and the move toward a coordinated community response to domestic violence. While treatment standards were derived from the understanding of husband violence, as it existed at the time, newer research data do not validate many of the assumptions underlying current standards. This point is illustrated by considering four such assumptions: (1) conjoint treatment is never appropriate, (2) we know the best length, content, and process of treatment, (3) in treatment, one size fits all, and (4) doing something is better than doing nothing. Recent research data relevant to each assumption is also considered. Given the lack of empirical support for these assumptions, it is too early to impose standards mandating one type of treatment. In fact, doing so may stifle what is needed most at this time--the development of new intervention approaches that may increase treatment efficacy. However, with the freedom to develop new interventions comes the responsibility to empirically validate these approaches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

These include outreach to victims, communication with the courts, and the need for intervention programs to address domestic abuse directly in their program content. Maryland has also established a research task force on Abuser Intervention Programs, whose goal is to use empirical data to inform the use of best practices in the state, to facilitate empirical research at abuser intervention programs in Maryland, and to develop more detailed program standards in the future.
