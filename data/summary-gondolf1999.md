Using naturalistic observations<!-- of program practices --> and key informant<!--(i.e., program participants' current romantic partners)--> reports of IPV perpetrators' reassault rates `during the first`<!-- over the course of--> 15 months following their initial intake into the `intervention program`, @gondolf1999comparison provides a<!--`foundational`--> comparative evaluation of four IPV perpetrator intervention systems in four U.S. cities (i.e., Pittsburg, PA; Houston, TX; Dallas, TX; and Denver, CO).<!-- EDIT: TOO LONG OF A SENTENCE--> Findings from this study are, however, somewhat mixed in that comparisons to evaluate differences in reassault rates across the four study sites, representing a continuum of least-to-most comprehensive IPV perpetration intervention systems, showed few meaningful differences across intervention sites. `Distinctions across the four sites are, however, more evident when individual perpetrator characteristics (e.g., psychopathology, substance abuse, previous arrests, etc.) and referral sources (e.g., court-mandated versus referral sources outside the court system) are also taken into account.` Further, while there was no significant effect of intervention site on reassault rates, the effect of the most comprehensive intervention system among the four included in the study `does tend toward significance`, particularly when this site's effect is compared with the least comprehensive intervention system included in this evaluation.

Overall, the total recidivism rate observed across all four programs was 32% (_n_ = 210) for physical reassault and 43-70% for non-physical forms of violence and abuse (i.e., controlling behaviors, 45%; verbal abuse, 70%; and threats, 43%). In addition, 72% (_n_ = 343) partner respondents reported that they "feel 'very safe'" and 66% (_n_ = 281) indicated that they were "'very unlikely' to be hit". However, only 12% (_n_ = 54) rated their overall quality of life following their partners' completion of the intervention as "better", another 12% rated their quality of life as "worse", while 22% (_n_ = 100) rated their quality of life as the "same" as it was prior to their partners' intervention participation (p. 53).

Despite these mixed findings, @gondolf1999comparison\'s, relatively, early investigation into the possible differential effects of IPV perpetrator intervention systems representing four distinct points along a continuum from least-to-most comprehensive systems informs questions regarding system-, dyadic-, and individual-level factors that may influence these systems' efficacy at reducing reassault among men who have perpetrated IPV toward one or more female intimate partners. In particular, @gondolf1999comparison\'s findings regarding differences across the four intervention systems were most informative to understanding the effectiveness of IPV perpetrator programs when multiple levels of analysis are considered. That is, the effects of intervention systems' characteristics (i.e., comprehensiveness of services and intervention program length) on reassault rates appears `rather` sensitive to the inclusion of system-level variables not specific to the IPV perpetrator intervention itself (e.g., referral sources) and dyadic- and individual-level variables (e.g., victim-perpetrator contact during the 15-month study period, perpetrators' IPV-related and non-IPV-related criminal backgrounds, perpetrators' substance use or abuse, etc.) in each analysis.

The primary data source for @gondolf1999comparison\'s study's outcome variables is key informant reports provided by participating IPV perpetrators' current romantic partners, `regardless of whether those partners were` the original victims leading to the men's intervention program participation<!-- EDIT -->. This sampling and data collection method is an interesting approach to evaluating IPV perpetrator interventions, and the use of key informant reports (e.g., victims', current and/or past romantic partners', and intervention program facilitators' perspectives used as primary or secondary reports of program participants' behavior) is `somewhat thematic across a subset of subsequently-published literature included in this review`<!-- EDIT --> [e.g., @gregory2002effects; @silvergleid2006how]. `An additionally notable characteristic of` @gondolf1999comparison\'s `evaluation report` is the transparency with which the study's results are presented. While the evaluation ultimately provided, at best, mixed support for more the effect of more comprehensive IPV perpetration intervention systems, the results are presented such a way that acknowledge the state of this specific practice's field, which, at the time of the study's publication, is possibly best characterized as disjointed and in need of a more concrete and consistent evidence-base.
