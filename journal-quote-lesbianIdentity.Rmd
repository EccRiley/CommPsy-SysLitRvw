> "Lesbian identity does not follow the well-worn ruts in the conventional road that lead from sex to gender to gender-role to gender-of-partner.In the same way, our families cannot be neatly mapped according to a conventional family tree, where connections are established by law (as in marriage) or by genetic connections. Invisible through those lenses, our families have thrived nonetheless."
