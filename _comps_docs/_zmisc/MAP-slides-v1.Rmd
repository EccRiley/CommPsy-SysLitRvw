# Part I. Background & Significance

## Rationale for the Present Review

> "... despite our awareness of context for those we study, we do not always apply that understanding to ourselves".

`r tufte::newthought("Community psychological values, theories, and methods favor...")`

- inclusion over exclusion
- participant voices considered equally with researchers' voices
- participatory or purposive sampling methods

> `r tufte::quote_footer("[@balcazar2004participatory; @senn2005you; @maguire1987doing]")`

- resistance to research methodologies, social policies, and implementation practices that ultimately served to reinforce and/or strengthen social and economic inequalities

## Theoretical Grounding

> "... community scientists study domestic violence using methods and theories that are consistent with the view that domestic violence is not just an individual behavior, but a complex process shaped by historical, social, financial, and legal contexts".

> `r tufte::quote_footer("--- @luke2005getting, p. 185")`

- Social **Ecological** framework [@espino2008spirit; @kelly1977social; @dahlberg2002violence]
- **Action**-oriented theory and methodology [@kelly2004community; @seidman2012emerging]
- Social scientific theory related to **IPV** and **sexual minority women** [@meyer1995minority; @meyer2015resilience]
