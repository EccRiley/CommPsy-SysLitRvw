# V. Literature Review

# V.1. IPV Interventions Research

## Specific Research Topics

The primary research topic across the empirical literature reviewed here is evaluation of IPV interventions. However, the level, scope, and specific foci of evaluations is somewhat varied across this literature. 

## Methodologies & Methods Utilized

The majority of the reviewed studies follow quantitatively-based methodologies (n = 14; 61%), with just over a quarter (n = 6) employing qualitatively-based methodologies, and only four studies utilizing mixed-methodological approaches. Of the reviewed quantitatively-based studies, 86% (n = 12) employed experimental and/or longitudinal, rather than cross-sectional, designs. All but one of the quantitative studies (93%) used self-report survey measures as the primary datasource. Four of the six qualitatively-based studies used group interviews as the primary data collection method, one administered and analyzed responses to a qualitative self-report survey, and one employed a multi-method qualitative approach. The methods represented among studies following mixed-methodological designs include experimental and longitudinal mixed-methods, focus groups, and qualitative and quantitative self-report measures.

## Populations Included/Sampling Frames

<!-- Among samples in both categories of the research (i.e., IPV Interventions & LGBTQ-Specific IPV Research), females, women, and girls are the most represented population (_n_ = 21 of the 65 reviewed studies); with LGBTQ-specific IPV research studies comprising the majority of studies including females, women, and/or girls in their samples. -->
