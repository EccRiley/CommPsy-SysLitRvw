## Specific Research Topics

The primary research topic across the empirical literature reviewed here is evaluation of interventions targeting IPV perpetration or victimization. However, the level, scope, and specific focus on evaluations is somewhat varied across this literature. `[...`\todo `...]`


<!-- ## Brief History of IPV Perpetrator Interventions

> "In 1977, eight men who were friends of women's activists in the Boston area came together to form a men's collective called _EMERGE_ [@adams1982men]. They began to provide services to batterers. Their creation of services for batterers responded to the frustration of shelter workers who noted that women were being beaten when they returned home, and to the observation that some men were moving from one violent relationship to another. _EMERGE_ became one of the first organizations to offer group treatment for men who batter. The growth of services for batterers rapidly followed the founding of _EMERGE_ [@feazell1984services; @pirog1985male]" [@tolman1995intervention, p. 2; @adams2002emerge].

> "During the same period that batterers programs were being established, the dramatic proliferation of family treatment models resulted in attempts at counseling couples and families with men who abused their partners [@coleman1980conjugal; @cook1984systemic; @geller1982conjoint; @geller1977treatment; @margolin1979conjoint]. The use of these models for intervention with batterers has created a great deal of controversy, however, family and couple treatment interventions constitute a small minority of interventions discussed or evaluated in the research literature" [@tolman1995intervention, pp. 2-3].

## IPV Perpetrator Intervention Evaluations

Using naturalistic observations<!-- of program practices --> and key informant<!--(i.e., program participants' current romantic partners)--> reports of IPV perpetrators' reassault rates `during the first`<!-- over the course of--> 15 months following their initial intake into the `intervention program`, @gondolf1999comparison provides a<!--`foundational`--> comparative evaluation of four IPV perpetrator intervention systems in four U.S. cities (i.e., Pittsburg, PA; Houston, TX; Dallas, TX; and Denver, CO).<!-- EDIT: TOO LONG OF A SENTENCE--> Findings from this study are, however, somewhat mixed in that comparisons to evaluate differences in reassault rates across the four study sites, representing a continuum of least-to-most comprehensive IPV perpetration intervention systems, showed few meaningful differences across intervention sites. `Distinctions across the four sites are, however, more evident when individual perpetrator characteristics (e.g., psychopathology, substance abuse, previous arrests, etc.) and referral sources (e.g., court-mandated versus referral sources outside the court system) are also taken into account.` Further, while there was no significant effect of intervention site on reassault rates, the effect of the most comprehensive intervention system among the four included in the study `does tend toward significance`, particularly when this site's effect is compared with the least comprehensive intervention system included in this evaluation.

Overall, the total recidivism rate observed across all four programs was 32% (_n_ = 210) for physical reassault and 43-70% for non-physical forms of violence and abuse (i.e., controlling behaviors, 45%; verbal abuse, 70%; and threats, 43%). In addition, 72% (_n_ = 343) partner respondents reported that they "feel 'very safe'" and 66% (_n_ = 281) indicated that they were "'very unlikely' to be hit". However, only 12% (_n_ = 54) rated their overall quality of life following their partners' completion of the intervention as "better", another 12% rated their quality of life as "worse", while 22% (_n_ = 100) rated their quality of life as the "same" as it was prior to their partners' intervention participation (p. 53).

Despite these mixed findings, @gondolf1999comparison\'s, relatively, early investigation into the possible differential effects of IPV perpetrator intervention systems representing four distinct points along a continuum from least-to-most comprehensive systems informs questions regarding system-, dyadic-, and individual-level factors that may influence these systems' efficacy at reducing reassault among men who have perpetrated IPV toward one or more female intimate partners. In particular, @gondolf1999comparison\'s findings regarding differences across the four intervention systems were most informative to understanding the effectiveness of IPV perpetrator programs when multiple levels of analysis are considered. That is, the effects of intervention systems' characteristics (i.e., comprehensiveness of services and intervention program length) on reassault rates appears `rather` sensitive to the inclusion of system-level variables not specific to the IPV perpetrator intervention itself (e.g., referral sources) and dyadic- and individual-level variables (e.g., victim-perpetrator contact during the 15-month study period, perpetrators' IPV-related and non-IPV-related criminal backgrounds, perpetrators' substance use or abuse, etc.) in each analysis.

The primary data source for @gondolf1999comparison\'s study's outcome variables is key informant reports provided by participating IPV perpetrators' current romantic partners, `regardless of whether those partners were` the original victims leading to the men's intervention program participation<!-- EDIT -->. This sampling and data collection method is an interesting approach to evaluating IPV perpetrator interventions, and the use of key informant reports (e.g., victims', current and/or past romantic partners', and intervention program facilitators' perspectives used as primary or secondary reports of program participants' behavior) is `somewhat thematic across a subset of subsequently-published literature included in this review`<!-- EDIT --> [e.g., @gregory2002effects; @silvergleid2006how]. `An additionally notable characteristic of` @gondolf1999comparison\'s `evaluation report` is the transparency with which the study's results are presented. While the evaluation ultimately provided, at best, mixed support for more the effect of more comprehensive IPV perpetration intervention systems, the results are presented such a way that acknowledge the state of this specific practice's field, which, at the time of the study's publication, is possibly best characterized as disjointed and in need of a more concrete and consistent evidence-base.

A comparative evaluation was also conducted by @hendricks2006recidivism with two IPV perpetrator intervention programs in a small metropolitan Wisconsin county [@ingram2012nchs]. Although @hendricks2006recidivism ultimately describes the programs evaluated their investigation as two independent interventions, one of the programs, _"Reasoning & Rehabilitation (R&R)"_ is in fact evaluated as a `sort of nested or secondary` intervention within the county's larger IPV perpetrator intervention system, _"Stopping Abuse for Everyone (SAFE)"_ (p. 704). That is, individuals are referred to the _R&R_ program `if they are determined as in need of` greater levels of supervision based on a clinical assessment administered during the _SAFE_ program's intake process. Such individuals are expected to return to and complete the _SAFE_ program's intervention after completing the additional _R&R_ program. @hendricks2006recidivism\'s investigation also included an evaluation of the predictive validity of the _Level of Service Inventoryâ€“Revised_ [_LSI-R_; @andrews1994level], which is the assessment administered to determine intervention participants' levels of risk and need at intake for the _SAFE_ program. Regarding the latter, results from logistic regression analyses provided minimal support for the LSI-R scale's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in correctly classifying recidivating intervention participants (overall classification accuracy = 66% correct). However, while formal logistic regression analysis was not similarly conducted to examine the measure's predictive accuracy regarding program placement, comparisons<!-- via between-subjects factorial--> via cross-tabulations and chi-square ($\chisq$) analyses revealed significant differences in both LSI-R scores and recidivism rates among intervention participants. Specifically, participants who completed the _SAFE_ program without referral to the _R&R_ program (14.4% recidivated) had significantly lower recidivism rates than those who completed both interventions (32.4% recidivated; $\chisq(1) = 6.26,~p < .05$). As @hendricks2006recidivism note, because participants were referred to the _R&R_ program on the basis of their LSI-R scores, these differences in recidivism rates do not necessarily inform comparisons regarding each intervention program's individual effectiveness at reducing or preventing future violence perpetration among participants. However, a possibly missing point in @hendricks2006recidivism\'s report and analytic conclusions is that these observed differences may provide support for the discriminant validity of the LSI-R as a measure effective in determining the relative risk and needs levels of IPV perpetration intervention participants.

`In a separate effort to` inform the question of IPV perpetrator intervention effectiveness from the victims'/survivors' perspectives, @gregory2002effects conducted in-depth one-on-one interviews with 33 women identified via police reports as having experienced IPV victimization perpetrated by men referred to a local IPV perpetrator intervention program in a rural Ohio county. Interview questions sought information regarding the offenders' behaviors before, during, and after their participation in the intervention. Regarding survivors' accounts of offenders' behaviors prior to being referred to the intervention, the authors found that many of the men entering the intervention had also been physically violent with past romantic partners, close relatives, and male friends. In addition, a substantial proportion of survivor respondents indicated that jealousy, substance abuse, and family-related issues (e.g., issues related to children, finances, household chores, etc.) were apparent causes of conflict leading to the perpetrators' use of violence. Survivors' also provided insights into their assessments of more underlying causes of abuse, including issues related to power and control, their partners' low self-esteem, and conflict related to sexual/intimacy issues and the perpetrators' infidelity in the relationship. Regarding program participants' partners' accounts of the intervention's effectiveness, the majority of the 33 respondents in @gregory2002effects\'s evaluation indicated either a decrease or complete elimination of violence in their relationships, while a third of the partners reported that the intervention program in fact became a new source of conflict in their relationship, and 19% reported abuse during or following the offenders' program completion.

A particularly notable descriptive finding from @gregory2002effects\'s investigation is that, on average, over seven years lapsed between the first occurrence of IPV in the relationships accounted for by the study's survivor respondents and the IPV incident resulting in the perpetrators' referrals to the intervention program. Although not explicitly connected in the study's findings report nor discussion, this finding may inform survivor respondents' apparent consensus that jail time should be an immediate and/or unconditional sanction imposed against individuals found guilty and/or under investigation for IPV perpetration. Further, an average time-lapse of this magnitude indicates a potentially critical flaw in the implantation of any form of a coordinated community response to IPV [@hart1995coordinated].

@gregory2002effects\'s evaluation is restricted to female survivors' accounts of male IPV perpetrators court-mandated, either as part of post-sentencing probationary requirements or deferred-sentencing conditions, to complete the intervention, and therefore does not include accounts of the intervention programs' participants who are not referred to the program by the courts. @gregory2002effects\'s sample further excludes accounts of same-gender IPV perpetration or victimization, as well as IPV perpetrated by female-identified individuals toward male-identified partners. This sampling frame is similar to that defined in @gondolf1999comparison\'s investigation (summarized above) both in terms of the specific included and excluded populations, as well as the fact that the sampling restrictions in both studies are, at least to some degree, a function of the populations served by the study sites themselves. That is, at the time the studies were conducted, the intervention programs evaluated in both investigations provided IPV perpetrator intervention services only to male-identified individuals who perpetrated IPV toward female-identified partners.
