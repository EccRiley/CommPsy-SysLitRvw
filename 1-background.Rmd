# I. Background & Significance

I propose conducting a systematic critical review of research conducted with marginalized populations, with a specific focus on violence-related research with sexual minority women (SMW).^[[see relevance to dissertation topic]] The critical review will attempt to map core components of community psychological theory and methodologies to the body of research available under the above-defined content and research discipline scopes. In particular, I am interested in evaluating the extent to which community psychological theory and methodologies are implemented, or not, in community psychology-based research related to the phenomenon of interest (i.e., intimate partner violence). I am further interested in examining how the implementation of community psychological research has evolved over time since the origination of the field, as well as potential trajectories based on the current state of discourse within Community Psychology and closely related research and practice disciplines.

Community psychological theory values the notion that the communities in which research is taking place and/or affecting (whether directly or indirectly) should be as involved as possible in all phases of the research process, rather than solely as anonymous data points in the analysis. Community psychology thus favors inclusion over exclusion, participant voices equally with researchers' voices, and participatory and/or purposive sampling methods over convenience sampling methods. The reviewed literature will be evaluated and critiqued according to these types of community psychological standards regarding (1) _research methodologies_, (2) _data analytic approaches_, (3) _interpretations of findings_, and (4) _research dissemination._


## Rationale

There are two core components of my action-oriented research framework: (1) a focus on developing and implementing innovative and inclusive research methodologies, data analytic approaches, and dissemination strategies; and (2) a diligent focus on the importance of critical reflexivity throughout the research process. The action-oriented and values-transparent community psychological research approach was born out of a resistance to research methodologies, social policies, and implementation practices that ultimately served to reinforce and/or strengthen social and economic inequalities. This foundation necessitates vigilance in critical reflexivity throughout and beyond the research process. The critical literature review I am proposing here is intended to serve this key characteristic of community psychology.
